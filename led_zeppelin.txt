Going To  with an  in my heart.

Someone told me there's a girl out there

With love in her eyes and  in her hair.

Took my  on a big jet plane

Never let them tell you that they're all the same.

The sea was red and the sky was grey

Wondered how  could ever  today.

The  and the  started to  and shake

As the  of the sun  to awake.

Seems that the  of the Gods

Got a  on the nose and it  to flow;

I  I  be sinking.

Throw me a line if I  it in time

I'll meet you up  where the path

Runs  and high.

To find a  without a king;

They say she  guitar and  and sings.

La la la la

Side a  mare in the  of dawn

Tryin' to find a  who's never, never,  been born.

Standing on a hill in my  of dreams,

Telling  it's not as hard, hard, hard as it seems

Should I fall out of love, my fire in the light

To  a  in the wind

Within the glow that  a  of delight

There  a  that has no end



For many  and days that pass ever soon

The  have  the  to dim

At last the arm is straight, the hand to the loom

Is this to end or just begin?



All of my love, all of my love

All of my love to you, oh



All of my love, all of my love, oh

All of my love to you



The cup is raised, the  is made yet again

One  is  above the din

Proud  one word, my will to sustain

For me, the  once more to spin, oh



All of my love, all of my love, oh

All of my love to you



All of my love, all of my love, yes

All of my love to you 



Yours is the cloth, mine is the hand that sews time

His is the  that lies within

Ours is the fire, all the  we can find

He is a  in the wind, oh



All of my love, all of my love, oh

All of my love to you

--------------------------------------------------------------

Sisters of the way-side bide  time in  peace

Await  place  the ring of calm

Still  to turn in  of release

Await the call they know may  come

In  of lightness, no  dared upon 

To  the course,  the run

And all was joy and  were  toward the sun 

As love in the  of  overrun

Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh



Still in  bliss  mighty  

Unending  shadowed on the day

Within  walls,  daunting  keep

Preserved  joy and kept  doubts at bay

Faceless  stood in  to weep

Just turn a coin,  order to the fray

And  is soon no  thought than deed 

But no one  to  in anyway

Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh



How keen the  hunter's eye  upon the land 

To seek the  and the weak

And  the  sat, too smug to lift a hand 

Toward the foe that  from the deep

Who  to dry the  of  who  stand 

Adrift upon a sea of  speech? 

And to fall to fate and make the 'status plan' 

But no one  had  within  reach

Singing uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh



Oh, oh, oh 



Oh, oh 



Oh



Where was your word,  did you go?

Where was your helping,  was your bow? Bow

Bow



Dull is the armour, cold is the day

Hard was the journey, dark was the way, way



I  the word, I couldn't stay, oh

I couldn't  it  day,  day

Another day,  day



Touched by the  coming

Roused from the keeper's sleep

Release the grip,  down the key



Held now  the knowing

Rest now  the peace

Take of the fruit, but  the seed



They had to stay

Held now  the knowing

Rest now  the peace

Take off the fruit, but  the seed



Take off the fruit, but  the seed

How  we say no?



Oh, the fun to have

To live the  we  had

Oh, the  to sing

When we at last  again



Slipping off a  kiss

To  who  they know

Below the  that  and hiss

Oh, to sail away

To  lands and  days

Oh, to  the dream

Hides  and  seen, yeah



Into the sun, the south, the north

At last the  have flown

The  of  fell

In  on the ground



Oh, to ride the wind

To  the air  the din

Oh, to  aloud

Dancing as we  the crowds, yeah



To seek the man  pointing hand

The  step unfolds

With  from the  path

That  up into stone



If one bell  ring

In  for a king

So fast the  should beat

As  the head with  feet, yeah



Days went by when you and I

Bathed in  summer's glow

As far away and distant

Our  child did grow



Oh the  refrain

Soothes the soul and  the pain

Oh  remains

Sleeping now to rise again



Wandering and wandering

What  to rest the search?

The  arms of Atlas

Hold the  from the earth



For the  arms of Atlas

Hold the  from the earth

From the earth



I know the way, know the way, know the way, know the way

Spent my days with a  unkind

Smoked my  and  all my wine.

Made up my mind to make a new start

Going To  with an  in my heart.

Someone told me there's a girl out there

With love in her eyes and  in her hair.

Took my  on a big jet plane

Never let them tell you that they're all the same.

The sea was red and the sky was grey

Wondered how  could ever  today.

The  and the  started to  and shake

As the  of the sun  to awake.

Seems that the  of the Gods

Got a  on the nose and it  to flow;

I  I  be sinking.

Throw me a line if I  it in time

I'll meet you up  where the path

Runs  and high.

To find a  without a king;

They say she  guitar and  and sings.

La la la la

Side a  mare in the  of dawn

Tryin' to find a  who's never, never,  been born.

Standing on a hill in my  of dreams,

Telling  it's not as hard, hard, hard as it seems

Here's a tale of Tom 

Who  the  long

His wife  cook his meal

As he  change the wheel



Poor Tom,  son, 

Always knew what's goin' on 

Ain't a  that you can hide from Tom 

There ain't  that you can hide from Tom 



Worked for  years 

Sharing  and  

Dreamin' of the day 

He  turn and say 



Poor Tom, work's done, 

Been lazin' out in the  sun 



Ain't a  that you can hide from Tom 

Ain't a  that you can hide from Tom 



His wife was  Mae 

With any man a game she'd play

When Tom was out of town 

She couldn't keep her  down 



Poor Tom,  son, 

Always knew what's goin' on 



Ain't a  that you can hide from Tom 

Ain't a  that you can hide from Tom 



And so it was one day 

People got to  Mae 

Tom stood, a gun in his hand 

And  her runnin'  



Poor Tom,  son, 

Gotta die for what you've done 



All  years of work are  away 

To ease your mind is that all you can say? 



But what  that  on your knee? 

Them  songs, Tom  sing to me



(Ain't  that you can hide from Tom) 

Hey

(Keep-a truckin')

--------------------------------------------------------------

There's a lady who's sure

All that  is gold

And she's  a  to heaven

When she gets  she knows

If the  are all closed

With a word she can get what she came for

Oh oh oh oh and she's  a  to heaven



There's a sign on the wall

But she  to be sure

'Cause you know  words have two meanings

In a tree by the brook

There's a  who sings

Sometimes all of our  are misgiving



Ooh, it  me wonder

Ooh, it  me wonder



There's a  I get

When I look to the west

And my  is  for leaving

In my  I have seen

Rings of  through the trees

And the  of  who  looking



Ooh, it  me wonder

Ooh, it  makes me wonder



And it's  that soon, If we all call the tune

Then the  will lead us to reason

And a new day will dawn

For  who  long

And the  will echo with laughter



If there's a  in your hedgerow

Don't be  now

It's just a  clean for the May queen

Yes,  are two  you can go by

But in the long run

There's  time to  the road you're on

And it  me wonder



Your head is  and it won't go

In case you don't know

The piper's  you to join him

Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow

And did you know

Your  lies on the  wind



And as we wind on down the road

Our  taller than our soul

There  a lady we all know

Who  white  and  to show

How  still  to gold

And if you  very hard

The tune will come to you at last

When all are one and one is all

To be a rock and not to roll

And she's  the  to heaven

--------------------------------------------------------------

Measuring a summer's day, I only  it  away to grey

The hours, they  me pain



Tangerine, Tangerine,  reflection from a dream

I was her love, she was my queen, and now a  years between



Thinking how it used to be

Does she  remember  like these? 

To  of us again?

And I do



Tangerine, Tangerine,  reflection from a dream

I was her love, she was my queen, and now a  years between

--------------------------------------------------------------

If the sun  to shine
I  still be  you
When  crumble to the sea
There will  be you and me

Kind woman, I give you my all
Kind woman,  more

Little  of rain  of the pain
Tears of  lost in the days gone by
My love is strong, with you  is no wrong
Together we  go  we die
My, my, my  is what you are to me
Inspiration look, see

And so today, my  it smiles
Your hand in mine, we walk the miles
Thanks to you it will be done
For you to me are the only one
Happiness, no more be sad
Happiness, I'm glad

If the sun  to shine
I  still be  you
Mountains  to the sea
There will  be you and me

--------------------------------------------------------------

The  of  embraced the gloom

And  the  alone.

Oh,  in the dark of night,

Sing to the  light.

The dark Lord  in  tonight

And time will tell us all.

Oh,  down your plow and hoe,

Rest not to lock your homes.

Side by side we wait the might

Of the  of them all.

I hear the horses' thunder

Down in the  blow,

I'm  for the  of Avalon,

Waiting for the  glow.

The  of the  hold,

The seas of happiness,

The  is rich from  care,

Repay, do not forget, no, no.

Oh,  in the dark of night,

Sing to the  light.

The  turn to  and black, the tyrant's face is red.

Oh the war is  cry, pick up you  and fly.

The sky is  with good and bad

That  never know.

Oh, well, the  is long, the  of time pass slow,

Tired eyes on the sunrise,  for the  glow.

The pain of war  exceed

The woe of aftermath,

The  will  the  wall,

The ring  ride in black, ride on.

Sing as you  your bow,

Shoot  than before.

No  has the fire at night

That  the face so cold.

Oh  in the dark of night,

Sing to the mornin' light.

The  runes are writ in gold

To  the  back,  it back.

At last the sun is shining, the  of blue roll by,

With  from the  of darkness

The  blinds his eyes.

Rivers  reach the sea

Blind  of fortune, each have  rays

On the  of maybe, down in  of prey

Kind of  me feel sometimes, didn't have to grow

But as the  leaves the nest, it's got so far to go



Changes fill my time, baby, that's  with me

And you knew you would



Through the eyes an' I sparkle

Senses  keen

Taste your love  the way

The nest is in our soul



Vixen in my dreams, with  surprise to me

The way it used to be

Oh darlin', oh darlin'

Event I  happen to fall

Time and his  growing older

I've got  who will give me fuck all



Lalalalalalalala, yeah

Lalalalalalalala, my baby

Lalalalalalalala, yeah

Lalalalalalalala



On the  of  and nowhere

In the land of not  day

A  ran down my backbone

Face in the  turns grey



So I  round to  up the reindeer

Searching hard  to  the day

I  around to look for the snowman

To my  he'd  away, yeah



Lalalalalalalala, yeah

Lalalalalalalala, my baby

Lalalalalalalala, yeah

Lalalalalalalala



As the moon and the  call the order

Inside my  dance the ebb and sway

The sun in my soul's  lower

While the hope in my  turns to clay

I don't ask that my field's full of clover

I don't moan at opportunity's door

And if you ask my advice, take it slower

Then your story'd be your  reward



Lalalalalalalala, yeah

Lalalalalalalala, my baby

Lalalalalalalala, yeah

Lalalalalalalala

oh oh oh oh

oh oh oh oh

oh oh oh oh

oh oh oh oh



Lost on the path to attainment

Search in the eyes of the wise

When I bled from the  of the matter

I  bleeding  a disguise



Now everything's fine  heaven

Now and then you've got to take time to pause

When you're down on the ground, don't be messin' around

Or you'll land in a boat  oars



Lalalalalalalala, yeah

Lalalalalalalala, my baby

Lalalalalalalala, yeah

Lalalalalalalala



Hey babe, Hey babe, Hey babe

Traversed the planet, when  sent me 

I saw the  who rule them all

And the wind is crying, from a love that won't grow cold

My lover, she is lying, on the dark side of the globe

You got me  when I  to be a-rolling

Darling, tell me, darling,  way to go

You keep me rocking, baby, then you keep me stolen

And our time is flying, see the  burning low

Is the new  rising, from the  of the old

If we  just, if we  just join hands

That's all it takes, that's all it takes

That's all it takes, that's all it takes

Wanted to date her  I don't know when 

But she don't  me when I pass

She goes with  guys from out of my class

But that can't stop me from-ah thinkin' to  

She's sure fine lookin' man

She's somethin' else



Hey look-ah there

Across the street

There's a car made just for me

To own that car  be a luxury

But  now I can't  the gas

A  new  is out of my class

But that can't stop me from-ah thinkin' to  

That car's fine lookin' man

It's somethin' else



Hey look-ah here

Just wait and see

Workin' hard and savin' my dough

I'll buy that car that I've be  so 

Get me that girl and we'll go ridin' around

The town will be all  with my  top down

I'll keep  on and dreamin' and-ah thinkin' to  

When it all  true, man

Wow! That's somethin' else



Look-ah here

What's all this?

Never  I'd do this before

But here I am ah-knockin' on her door 

My car's out  and it's all mine 

Just a '41 Ford not a '59

I got that girl and I'm-ah thinkin' to  

She's sure fine lookin' man

Wow! She's somethin' else

There's a lady who's sure

All that  is gold

And she's  a  to heaven

When she gets  she knows

If the  are all closed

With a word she can get what she came for

Oh oh oh oh and she's  a  to heaven



There's a sign on the wall

But she  to be sure

'Cause you know  words have two meanings

In a tree by the brook

There's a  who sings

Sometimes all of our  are misgiving



Ooh, it  me wonder

Ooh, it  me wonder



There's a  I get

When I look to the west

And my  is  for leaving

In my  I have seen

Rings of  through the trees

And the  of  who  looking



Ooh, it  me wonder

Ooh, it  makes me wonder



And it's  that soon, If we all call the tune

Then the  will lead us to reason

And a new day will dawn

For  who  long

And the  will echo with laughter



If there's a  in your hedgerow

Don't be  now

It's just a  clean for the May queen

Yes,  are two  you can go by

But in the long run

There's  time to  the road you're on

And it  me wonder



Your head is  and it won't go

In case you don't know

The piper's  you to join him

Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow

And did you know

Your  lies on the  wind



And as we wind on down the road

Our  taller than our soul

There  a lady we all know

Who  white  and  to show

How  still  to gold

And if you  very hard

The tune will come to you at last

When all are one and one is all

To be a rock and not to roll

And she's  the  to heaven
