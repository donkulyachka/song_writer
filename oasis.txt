How many  special  people change?

How many  lives  are  living  strange?

Where were you  while  we were  getting  high?



Slowly  walking  down the hall

Faster than a cannonball

Where were you  while  we were  getting  high?



Someday you will find me

Caught  beneath  the landslide

In a  champagne  supernova in the sky

Someday you will find me

Caught  beneath  the landslide

In a  champagne  supernova

A  champagne  supernova in the sky



Wake up the dawn and ask her why

A  dreamer  dreams, she  never  dies

Wipe that tear away now from your eye



Slowly  walking  down the hall

Faster than a cannonball

Where were you  while  we were  getting  high?



Someday you will find me

Caught  beneath  the landslide

In a  champagne  supernova in the sky

Someday you will find me

Caught  beneath  the landslide

In a  champagne  supernova

A  champagne  supernova



'Cause we don't believe

That they're  gonna  get away from the summer

But you and I will  never  die

The world's  still  spinning  around  we don't know why

Why, why, why, why

(Oh oh oh)I don't know what it is that  makes  me feel alive
I don't know how to wake the  things  that  sleep  inside
I only want to see the  light  that  shines  behind your eyes
I hope that I can say the  things  I wish I'd said
To sing my soul to  sleep  and take me back to bed
You want to be  alone  when we  could  be  alive  instead

Because we need each other
We  believe  in one another
I know we're  going  to uncover
What's sleepin' in our soul
Because we need each other
We  believe  in one another
(and) in know we're  going  to uncover
What's sleepin' in our soul
What's sleepin' in our soul

There are many  things  that I  would  like to know
And  there  are many  places  that I wish to go
But everything's  depending  on the way the wind may blow
I don't know what it is that  makes  me feel alive
I don't know how to wake the  things  that  sleep  inside
I only want to see the  light  that  shines  behind your eyes

Because we need each other
We  believe  in one another
I know we're  going  to uncover
What's sleepin' in our soul
Because we need each other
We  believe  in one another
(and) in know we're  going  to uncover
What's sleepin' in our soul
What's sleepin' in our soul

What's sleepin' in our soul
What's sleepin' in our soul
'cause we believeI'm free to be  whatever  I
Whatever I choose
And I'll sing the  blues  if I want

I'm free to say  whatever  I
Whatever I like
If it's  wrong  or  right  it's alright

Always  seems  to me
You only see what  people  want you to see
How long's it  gonna  be
Before we get on the bus
And  cause  no fuss
Get a grip on yourself
It don't cost much

Free to be  whatever  you
Whatever you say
If it  comes  my way it's alright

You're free to be  wherever  you
Wherever you please
You can  shoot  the  breeze  if you want

Before we get on the bus
And  cause  no fuss
Get a grip on yourself

Whatever I choose
And I'll sing the  blues  if I want

Here in my mind
You know you  might  find
Something that you
You  thought  you once knew
But now it's all gone
And you know it's no fun
Yeah I know it's no fun
Oh I know it's no fun

My  today  fell in from the top

I  dream  of you and all the  things  you say

I  wonder  where you are now?



Hold me down all the world's asleep

I need you now  you've  knocked  me off my feet

I  dream  of you and we talk of  growing  old

But you said  please  don't



Slide in baby  together  we'll fly

I've  tried  praying but I don't know just what you're  saying  to me



Now that you're mine

We'll find a way

Of  chasing  the sun

Let me be the one who  shines  with you

In the  morning  we don't know what to do



Two of a kind

We'll find a way

To do what we've done

Let me be the one who  shines  with you

And we can  slide  away

Slide away

Slide away

Slide away, and give it all you've got

My today, fell in from the top

Or have I  finally  found  something  worth  living  for?

I was  looking  for some action

But all I  found  was  cigarettes  and alcohol



You  could  wait for a lifetime

To  spend  your days in the sunshine

You  might  as well do the  white  line

'Cause when it  comes  on top



You  gotta  make it happen!

You  gotta  make it happen!

You  gotta  make it happen!

You  gotta  make it happen!



Is it  worth  the aggravation

To find  yourself  a job when there's  nothing  worth  working  for?

It's a  crazy  situation

But all I need are  cigarettes  and alcohol!



You  could  wait for a lifetime

To  spend  your days in the sunshine

You  might  as well do the  white  line

He  lives  under a waterfall

Nobody can see him

Nobody  could  ever hear him call

You need to be yourself

You can't be no one else

I know a girl  called  Elsa

She's into Alka Seltzer

She  sniffs  it  through  a cane on a  supersonic  train

And she  makes  me laugh

She done it with a  doctor  on a helicopter

She's  sniffin  in her tissue

Sellin' the Big Issue

You're here on your own who you  gonna  find to blame?



You're the outcast, you're the underclass

But you don't care,  because  you're  living  fast



You're the  uninvited  guest who  stays  'till the end

How your  garden  grows cos I just want to fly

Lately, did you ever feel the pain?

In the  morning  rain as it  soaks  you to the bone



Maybe I just want to fly I want to live I don't want to die

Maybe I just want to  breathe  maybe I just don't believe

Maybe you're the same as me we see  things  they'll  never  see you and I

were  gonna  live forever

By the side of the road

Just as the sky  turned  black

I took a walk with my fame

Down  memory  lane

I  never  did find my way back

You know that I  gotta  say time's  slipping  away

And what will it hold for me

What am I  gonna  do  while  I'm  looking  at you

You're  standing  ignoring me



I  thought  that I  heard  someone say now

There's no time for  running  away now

Hey now! Hey now



Feel no  shame  'cause time's no chain

Feel no shame



The  first  thing I saw

As I  walked  through the door

Was a sign on the wall that read

It said you  might  never know

That I want you to know

What is  written  inside of your head

And time as it stands

Won't be held in my hands

Or  living  inside of my skin

And as it fell from the sky

I  asked  myself why

Can I  never  let  anyone  in?



I  thought  that I  heard  someone say now

There's no time for  running  away now

When you're  chained  to the  mirror  and the  razor  blade

Today's the day that all the  world  will see

Another  sunny  afternoon



Walking to the  sound  of my  favorite  tune

Tomorrow  never  knows what it doesn't know too soon



Need a  little  time to wake up

Need a  little  time to wake up wake up

Need a  little  time to wake up wake up

Need a  little  time to wake up

Need a  little  time to rest your mind



You know you  should  so I  guess  you  might  as well

What's the  story  morning glory?

Well

Need a  little  time to wake up wake up

Well

What's the  story  morning glory?

Well

You need a  little  time to wake up wake up

Well

What's the  story  morning glory?

Well

Need a  little  time to wake up wake up

Well

What's the  story  morning glory?

(I said) well

Need a  little  time to wake up wake upShe's electric

She's in a  family  full of eccentrics

She's done  things  I  never  expected

And I need more time



She's got a sister

And God only  knows  how I've  missed  her

And on the palm of her hand is a blister

And I need more time



And I want you to know

I've got my mind made up now (mind made up now)

But I need more time

And I want you to say

"Do you know what I'm saying?" (what I'm saying)

But I need more



'Cause I'll be you and you'll be me

There's lots and lots for us to see

Lots and lots for us to do

She is electric, can I be  electric  too?



She's got a brother

We don't get on with one another

But I  quite  fancy her mother

And I  think  that she  likes  me



She's got a cousin

In fact she's got 'bout a dozen

She's got one in the oven

But it's  nothing  to do with me



And I want you to know

I've got my mind made up now

But I need more time

And I want you to say

"Do you know what I'm saying?"

But I need more



'Cause I'll be you and you'll be me

There's lots and lots for us to see

There's lots and lots for us to do

She is electric, can I be  electric  too?



Can I be  electric  too?

Can I be  electric  too?

Can I be  electric  too?Today is  gonna  be the day

That they're  gonna  throw it back to you

By now you should've somehow

Realized what you  gotta  do

I don't  believe  that anybody

Feels the way I do,  about  you now



Backbeat, the word was on the street

That the fire in your  heart  is out

I'm sure you've  heard  it all before

But you  never  really had a doubt

I don't  believe  that anybody

Feels the way I do  about  you now



And all the  roads  we have to walk are winding

And all the  lights  that lead us  there  are blinding

There are many  things  that I

Would like to say to you but I don't know how



Because maybe, you're  gonna  be the one that  saves  me

And  after  all, you're my wonderwall



Today was  gonna  be the day

But they'll  never  throw it back to you

By now you should've somehow

Realized what you're not to do

I don't  believe  that anybody

Feels the way I do,  about  you now



And all the  roads  that lead you  there  are winding

And all the  lights  that  light  the way are blinding

There are many  things  that I

Would like to say to you but I don't know how



I said maybe, you're  gonna  be the one that  saves  me

And  after  all, you're my wonderwall



I said maybe, you're  gonna  be the one that  saves  me

And  after  all, you're my wonderwall



I said maybe, you're  gonna  be the one that  saves  me

you're  gonna  be the one that  saves  me

you're  gonna  be the one that  saves  meI don't feel as if I know you

You take up all my time

The days are long and the  nights  will  throw  you away

'Cause the sun don't shine



Nobody ever  mentions  the weather

Can make or  break  your day

Nobody ever  seems  to remember

Life is a game we play



We live in the  shadows  and we

Had the  chance  and  threw  it away

And it's  never  going to be the same

'Cause the  years  are  falling  by like the rain

It's  never  gonna be the same

Till the life I knew  comes  to my  house  and says

Hello



There ain't no  sense  in  feeling  lonely

They got no  faith  in you

But I've got a  feeling  you  still  owe me

So wipe the shit from your shoes

Hello, hello, helloHere's a  thought  for  every  man

Who  tries  to  understand  what is in his  hands  (what is in his hands)

He  walks  along the open road of love and life

Surviving if he can (surviving if he can)



Bound with all the  weight  of all the  words  he  tried  to say

Chained to all the  places  that he  never  wished to stay

Bound with all the  weight  of all the  words  he  tried  to say

And as he  faced  the sun he cast no shadow



As they took his soul they  stole  his pride

As they took his soul they  stole  his pride

As they took his soul they  stole  his pride

And as he  faced  the sun he cast no shadow



Ah ah

Ah ah

Ah ah

Hello, hello, helloHead like a rock  spinning  round and round

I  found  it in a hole  sitting  upside down

You  point  the  finger  at me but I don't believe

Paint me a wish on a  velvet  sky

You  demand  the  answers  but don't know why

In my mind  there  is no time



Yeah  little  things they make me so happy

All I want to do is live by the sea

Yeah  little  things they make me so happy

But it's good yes it's good it's good to be free



So what  would  you say if I said to you

It's not in what you say it's in what you do

You  point  the  finger  at me but I don't believe

Bring it on home to  where  we found

Head is like a rock  sitting  upside down

That the  times  are changing

It's just for now

But not for good  

It's my  feelings  that I  think  you're training

Take them now 

If you  think  you  should  



You want  something  for nothing

The  higher  that you climb

The  longer  you fall

Maybe your time is coming

Will you up to climb

When you find the wall

Is it time to  doubt  ?

Is it time to wait ?

Will you be left alone

At the  starting  gate

I'm not blind

And I don't mind

Coz I've got time

Now I'm  alive  



The  people  have noticed

That the  times  are changing

But are they gonna

Be  something  now 

I  think  I've seen you all  hesitating  

I  think  I'll go 

And be  something  now 



You want  something  for nothing

The  higher  that you climb

The  longer  you fall

Maybe your time is coming

Will you up to climb

When you find the wall

Is it time to  doubt  ?

Is it time to wait ?

Will you be left alone

At the  starting  gate

I'm not blind

And I don't mind

Coz I've got time

Now I'm  alive  



Yeah I'm alive

Now I'm alive

Yeah I'm aliveWake up !  There's a new day dawning

I  think  I'll take a  little  walk for a while

I need  shades  'cause the sun is blinding

And I can see for  miles  and miles

Then I can feel the  earth  beneath me

I lie down we are as one

And they look but they  cannot  find me

I'm off  heading  for the sun 



I'm  getting  colder

I feel a  chill  the air

There's a  change  in the weather

Here it  comes  again

Now I can feel the rain 



The wind that  brings  on the change

Is  taking  me over 

The wind that  brings  on the rain

Is  making  me older

 

Downtown the moon is shining

I'm  gonna  dress me up in style

My  business  everybody's minding

I need to get away for a  while  



I'm  getting  colder

I feel a  chill  the air

There's a  change  in the weather

Here it  comes  again

Now I can feel the rain 



The wind that  brings  on the change

Is  taking  me over 

The wind that  brings  on the rain

Is  making  me olderThere we were now here we are 

All this  confusion  nothing's the same to me 

There we were now here we are 

All this  confusion  nothing's the same to me 



I can't tell you the way I feel 

Because the way I feel is oh so new to me 

I can't sell you the way I feel 

Because the way I feel is oh so new to me 



What I  heard  is not what I hear 

I can see the  signs  but they're not very  clear  

What I  heard  is not what I hear

Since I was Kid

Your  bringing  back  those  memories

Of the  thing  that we did

You're  hanging  round and  climbing  trees

Pretending to fly

D'yer want to be a  spaceman  and live in the sky

You got how many  bills  to pay

And how many kids

And you  forgot  

About the  things  that we did

The town  where  we're  living  

Has made you a man

And all of your  dreams  

Are  washed  in the sand

Well it's alright

It's alright

Who are you and me to say

What's  wrong  and what's right

Do you  still  feel like me

We sit down here

And we  shall  see

We can talk

And find  common  ground

And we can just forget

About  feeling  down

We can just forget

About life in this town. 

It's  funny  how your dreams

Change as you're  growing  old

You don't want to be no spaceman

You just want gold

Allthe  dream  stealers

Are  lying  in wait

But if you want to be a spaceman

It's  still  not too late 

Well it's alright

It's alright

Who are you and me to say

What's  wrong  and what's right

Do you  still  feel like me

We sit down here

And we  shall  see

We can just forget

About life in this townWhen I was young

I  thought  I had my own key

I knew  exactly  

What I  wanted  to be

Now I'm sure

You've  boarded  up  every  door



Lived in a bubble

Days were  never  ending

Was not  concerned  

About what life was sending

Fantasy was real

Now I know much  about  the way I feel



I'll  paint  you the picture

'Cause I don't think

You live  round  here no more

I've  never  even seen

The key to the door

We only get what we will  settle  for



While we're living

The  dreams  we have as  children  fade away

While we're living

The  dreams  we have as  children  fade away

While we're living

The  dreams  we have as  children  fade away

While we're living

The  dreams  we have as  children  fade away away away

They fade away away away



Now my life has turned

Another corner

I  think  it's only best

That I  should  warn you

Dream it  while  you can

Maybe  someday  I'll make you understand



I'll  paint  you the picture

'Cause I don't think

You live  round  here no more

I've  never  even seen

The key to the door

We only get what we will  settle  for



While we're living

The  dreams  we have as  children  fade away

While we're living

The  dreams  we have as  children  fade away

While we're living

The  dreams  we have as  children  fade away

While we're living

The  dreams  we have as  children  fade away away away

They fade away away away

They fade away away away

Fade away away awayI know a girl who's lost and lonely

Sits by the  phone  on her own

But the  phone  don't ring

And the  birds  don't sing in her tree

She lost  herself  in a haze of pity

And doesn't know  where  to run

She's a  headshrinker  now

And I  think  it's time we have some fun



Lost in a fog

I've been  treated  like a dog

And I'm out of here

I got no name

And I feel no shame

And I got no fear

And I bow down

To the  tears  of a clown

Whatever's  going  down

Is  coming  around

I hope you don't  regret  today



For the rest of your lives

For the rest of your lives

For the rest of your lives

For the rest of your lives



Lost in a fog

I've been  treated  like a dog

And I'm out of here

I got no name

And I feel no shame

And I got no fear

And I bow down

To the  tears  of a clown

Whatever's  going  down

For the rest of my life

There's no one else to  blame  but me

The  start  of the day's

Just the end of the night

I'm  feeling  like I'm lost at sea



Sometimes it just  seems  so simple

I'm  feeling  like I'm down on my knees

Sometimes like a man in the middle

I don't know my own mind

Won't you let me be



Coz I can find you

Living in my world

Dragging me round

Just like a dog on a lead

But when I find my

Own  peace  of mind I

I will believe



I'm  locked  up in  chains

Take me up to the top of the world

I want to see my crime



Day by day

There's a man in a suit

Who's  gonna  make you pay

For the  thoughts  that you think

And the  words  they won't let you say



One fine day

Gonna  leave  you all behind

It wouldn't be so bad

If I had more time



Sailing down a  river  alone

I've been tryin' to find my way back home

But I don't  believe  in magic

But I don't mind  being  on my own

And when it's time to start

Will you sit down here for  another  day

And when it's time to be

All the  things  that we

Are  wishing  away for  another  day



'cause in my soul we know  where  we're goin

We're goin  where  the  grass  is free

The air is  clean  and the good  times  are growin'

So take me away just for today

'cause I'm sat here on my own

I'd like to be  under  the sea

Where they'd  probably  need a phone



And just when it  falls  apart

Just when it's time to start

Will you sit down here for  another  day

I  could  be you if I  wanted  to

But I've  never  got the time

You  could  be me

And  pretty  soon you will be

But you're  gonna  need a line



Need a line

Need a line

Need a lineSittin' on my own
Chewin' on a bone
A  thousand  million  miles  from home
When  something  hit me
Somewhere  right  between the eyes

Sleepin' on a plane
You know you can't complain
You took your last  chance  once again
I  landed  stranded
Hardly even knew your name

I want to talk tonight
Until the mornin' light
'Bout how you  saved  my life
You and me see how we are
You and me see how we are

All your  dreams  are made
Of  strawberry  lemonade
And you make sure I eat today
You take me walking
To  where  you  played  when you were young

I'll  never  say that
I won't ever make you cry
And this I'll say I don't know why
I know I'm leavin'
But I'll be back  another  day

I want to talk tonight
Until the mornin' light
'Bout how you  saved  my life
(You  saved  my life)
I want to talk tonight
(I want to talk tonight)
'Bout how you  saved  my life
(I want to talk tonight)
'Bout how you  saved  my life
(I want to talk tonight)
'Bout how you  saved  my life
(I want to talk tonight)
'Bout how you  saved  my life
(I want to talk tonight)    (4x)Hey you up in the sky 

Learning to fly 

Tell me how high 

Do you  think  you'll go 

Before you  start  falling 



Hey you up in the tree 

You want to be me 

Well that couldn't be 

'Cause the  people  here they don't hear you  calling  



How does it feel 

When you're  inside  me? 



Hey you  wearing  the  crown  

Making no  sound  

I  heard  you feel down 

Well that's too bad 

Welcome to my  world  



Hey you  stealing  the  light  

I  heard  that the shine's 

Gone out of your life 

Well that's just too bad 

Welcome to my  world  



How does it feel 

When you're  inside  me? 



You'll need  assistance  with the  things  that you have  never  ever seen 

It's just a case of  never  breathing out 

Before you've  breathed  it in

'Cause livin' your life can be tough

Your  shame  is not enough



If  everybody  came alive

And  stayed  alive

And  lived  their  lives  instead, yeah

So come outside

And feel the light

It's cold inside

But it's  lonely  in your bed, in your bed



And you  though  we  might  be

But what you  heard  before

But if you came with me

The days'd  never  end

Would  never  be the same

They'd  never  be the same

They'd  never  be the same

Never be the same



It's  better  people, love one another

The days'd  never  end

Would  never  be the same

They'd  never  be the same

This is goin by a  different  name

They'd  never  be the sameMaybe I don't  really  wanna know

How your  garden  grows cos I just want to fly

Lately, did you ever feel the pain?

In the  morning  rain as it  soaks  you to the bone



Maybe I just want to fly I want to live I don't want to die

Maybe I just want to  breathe  maybe I just don't believe

Maybe you're the same as me we see  things  they'll  never  see you and I

were  gonna  live forever



I said  maybe  I don't  really  wanna know

How your  garden  grows cos I just want to fly

Lately, did you ever feel the pain?

In the  morning  rain as it  soaks  you to the bone



Maybe I will  never  be all the  things  that I want to be

But now is not the time to cry now's the time to find out why

I  think  you're the same as me we see  things  they'll  never  see you and I

We're  gonna  live forever



Maybe I don't  really  wanna know

How your  garden  grows cos I just want to fly

Lately, did you ever feel the pain?

In the  morning  rain as it  soaks  you to the bone



Maybe I just want to fly I want to live I don't want to die

Maybe I just want to  breathe  maybe I just don't believe

Maybe you're the same as me we see  things  they'll  never  see you and I

You and I are  gonna  live forever

We're  gonna  live forever



Gonna live  forever  

Gonna live  forever  

Gonna live  forever  

Gonna live  forever  

Gonna live foreverI'm  older  than I wish to be

This town  holds  no more for me

All my life I try to find  another  way

I don't care for your attitude

You  bring  me down I  think  you're rude

All my life I try to make a  better  day



It's hard  enough  being alone

Sitting here by the phone

Waiting for my memories

To come and play



It's hard  enough  sitting there

Rockin' in your rockin' chair

It's all too much for me to take

When you're not there



It's hard  enough  being alone

Sitting here by the phone

Waiting for my memories

To come and play



It's hard  enough  sitting there

Rockin' in your rockin' chair

Rockin' in your rockin' chair

It's all too much for me to take

When you're not thereYou  gotta  roll with it

You  gotta  take your time

You  gotta  say what you say

Don't let  anybody  get in your way

'Cause it's all too much for me to take



Don't ever  stand  aside

Don't ever be denied

You  wanna  be who you'd be

If you're  coming  with me



I  think  I've got a  feeling  I've lost inside

I  think  I'm  gonna  take me away and hide

I'm  thinking  of  things  that I just can't abide



I know the  roads  down  which  your life will drive

I find the key that lets you slip inside

Kiss the girl, she's not  behind  the door

But you know I  think  I  recognize  your face

But I've  never  seen you before



You  gotta  roll with it

You  gotta  take your time

You  gotta  say what you say

Don't let any  fucker  get in your way

'Cause it's all too much for me to take



I know the  roads  down  which  your life will drive

I find the key that lets you slip inside

Kiss the girl, she's not  behind  the door

But you know I  think  I  recognize  your face

You  gotta  roll with it

You  gotta  take your time

You  gotta  say what you say

Don't let  anybody  get in your way

In need of  education  in the rain

Feels the way I do,  about  you now



Backbeat, the word was on the street

That the fire in your  heart  is out

I'm sure you've  heard  it all before

But you  never  really had a doubt

I don't  believe  that anybody

Feels the way I do  about  you now



And all the  roads  we have to walk are winding

And all the  lights  that lead us  there  are blinding

There are many  things  that I

Would like to say to you but I don't know how



Because maybe, you're  gonna  be the one that  saves  me

And  after  all, you're my wonderwall

Lying to the  teacher  he  knows  he knows

He didn't and he should've

Brought his  lines  in yesterday

Ernie  bangs  the  sound  and the day begins

The  letterbox  is open and your cash  falls  in

I'll meet you at the office

Just  before  the  staff  clock in

The game is  kicking  off in  around  the park

It's  twenty  five a side and  before  it's dark

There's  gonna  be a loser

And you know the next goal wins

Cab it to the  front  as it's  called  a draw

Everybody's  knockin  at  yours  once more

Ernie  bangs  the sound

And no one's  spoken  since half past four

Today was just a blur, you've got a head like a  ghost  train

What was that  sound  ringing  around  your brain?

You're here on your own who you  gonna  find to blame?



You're the outcast, you're the underclass

But you don't care,  because  you're  living  fast



You're the  uninvited  guest who  stays  'till the end

I know you've got a  problem  that the  devil  sends

You  think  they're  talking  'bout you but you don't know who

I'll be  scraping  your life from the sole of my shoe tonight



Bring it on down,  bring  it down for me

Your head's in a fish tank

Your body and your mind can't breath

If you  would  come to mine for tea 

I'll pick you up at half past  three  

We'll have  lasagna  



I'll  treat  you like a  Queen  

I'll give you  strawberries  and  cream  

Then your  friends  will all go  green  

For my  lasagna  



These  could  be the best days of our  lives  

But I don't  think  we've been  living  very wise 

Oh no, no

Cos I've been  standing  at the station

In need of  education  in the rain

You made no  preparation  for my  reputation  once again

Don't you know you  might  find

A  better  place to play

You said that you'd  never  been

But all the  things  that you've seen

Will  slowly  fade away



So I  start  a  revolution  from my bed

'Cause you said the  brains  I had went to my head.

Step outside, summertime's in bloom

Stand up  beside  the fireplace

Take that look from off your face

You ain't ever  gonna  burn my  heart  out



And so  Sally  can wait, she  knows  it's too late as we're  walking  on by

Her soul  slides  away, but don't look back in  anger  I  heard  you say



Take me to the  place  where you go

Where  nobody  knows if it's  night  or day

But  please  don't put your life in the hands

Of a Rock n Roll band

Who'll  throw  it all away



I'm  gonna  start a  revolution  from my bed

'Cause you said the  brains  I had went to my head

Step  outside  'cause summertime's in bloom

Stand up  beside  the fireplace

Take that look from off your face

'Cause you ain't ever  gonna  burn my  heart  out



So  Sally  can wait, she  knows  it's too late as she's  walking  on by

My soul  slides  away, but don't look back in  anger  I  heard  you say



So  Sally  can wait, she  knows  it's too late as we're  walking  on by

Her soul  slides  away, but don't look back in  anger  I  heard  you say



So  Sally  can wait

She  knows  it's too late as she's  walking  on by

My soul  slides  away

But don't look back in anger

Don't look back in anger

I  heard  you say



At  least  not todayWhat she said she said to me

Take me high on a  mountain  side

She was  dressed  up in  leopard  skin

And her soul  would  never be denied



I met her down the  disco  in a beat up car

She was  burning  down the road

She  looked  just like a star with a Jaguar

She  needs  to  lighten  her load



And when you might

Think you're  gonna  cry

It will be all right

Step out tonight



You might

Think you're  gonna  cry

It will be all right

Step out tonight



What I said I said to her

I'm  alive  when you walk that way

Can you hear what I can hear ?

It's the  sound  of a  brand  new day



She met me down a  disco  in a beat up car

I was  burning  down the road

I can be a star in a Jaguar

I need to  lighten  my load



Because you  might  

Think you're  gonna  cry

It will be all right

Step out tonight



You might

Think you're  gonna  cry

It will be all right

Step out tonight



My  whole  life  still  sinking in the water

I need a ship not your  sweet  lip tonight



You might

Think you're  gonna  cry

It will be all right

Step out tonight



You might

Think you're  gonna  cry

It will be all right

Step out tonight



And if you might

Think you're  gonna  cry

It will be all right

Step out tonight



And when you might

Think you're  gonna  cry

It will be all right

Step out tonight



Step out tonight

Step out tonight

Step out tonight

Step out tonight

Step out tonight

Step out tonight

Step out tonight

Step out tonight

Step out tonight

Step out tonight

Tonight  tonight  tonight

Tonight  tonight  tonightUnderneath the sky of red

Is a  storyteller  sleeping alone

He has no face and he has no name

And his  whereabouts  are sort of unknown



All he  needs  is his life in a suitcase

It  belongs  to a  friend  of a friend's

And as we  drink  to ourselves

We'll  amuse  ourselves

Underneath the sky

Underneath the sky again

Underneath the sky again



So wish me away to an  unknown  place

Am I  living  in a land with no name

I'll be  making  a  start  with my  brand  new heart

Stop me  making  sense once again



All we need is our  lives  in a suitcase

They  belong  to a  friend  of a friend's

And as we  drink  to ourselves

We'll  amuse  ourselves

Underneath the sky

Underneath the sky again

Underneath the sky again



All we need is our  lives  in a suitcase

They  belong  to a  friend  of a friend's

And as we  drink  to ourselves

We'll  amuse  ourselves

On a ship of hope today

And as they fall upon the shore

Tell them not to fear no more

Say it loud and sing it proud

And they...



Will  dance  if they want to dance

Please  brother  take a chance

Which way they  wanna  go



All we know is that we don't know

What is  gonna  be

The best of all  things  that come our way

And all the  things  that came have past



The answer's in the  looking  glass

There's four and  twenty  million doors

Down life's  endless  corridor

Say it loud and sing it proud

Why we're all part of the masterplanIs it my imagination

Or have I  finally  found  something  worth  living  for?

I was  looking  for some action

But all I  found  was  cigarettes  and alcohol



You  could  wait for a lifetime

To  spend  your days in the sunshine

You  might  as well do the  white  line

'Cause when it  comes  on top



You  gotta  make it happen!

You  gotta  make it happen!

You  gotta  make it happen!

You  gotta  make it happen!



Is it  worth  the aggravation

To find  yourself  a job when there's  nothing  worth  working  for?

It's a  crazy  situation

But all I need are  cigarettes  and alcohol!



You  could  wait for a lifetime

I'd like to  build  myself a  house  out of plasticine

Ah,  shake  along with me

I've been  driving  in my car with my  friend  Mr. Soft

Mr.  Clean  and Mr. Ben are  living  in my loft

Ah,  shake  along with me

Ah,  shake  along with me



I'm  sorry  but I just don't know

I know I said I told you so

When you're  happy  and you're  feeling  fine

Then you'll know it's the  right  time

Then you'll know that it's the  right  time



To  shake  along with me

Shake  along  with me

I can't be no one else

I'm  feeling  supersonic

Give me gin and tonic

You can have it all but how much do you want it?



You make me laugh

Give me your autograph

Can I ride with you in your BMW?

You can sail with me in my  yellow  submarine

You need to find out

'Cause no one's  gonna  tell you what I'm on about

You need to find a way for what you want to say

But  before  tomorrow



'Cause my  friend  said he'd take you home

He sits in a  corner  all alone

He  lives  under a waterfall

Nobody can see him

Nobody can ever hear him call

Nobody can ever hear him call



You need to be yourself

You can't be no one else

I know a girl  called  Elsa

She's into Alka Seltzer

She  sniffs  it  through  a cane on a  supersonic  train

And she  makes  me laugh

I got her autograph

She done it with a  doctor  on a helicopter

She's  sniffin  in her tissue

Sellin' the Big Issue

When she  finds  out

No one's  gonna  tell you what I'm on about

You need to find a way for what you want to say

But  before  tomorrow



'Cause my  friend  said he'd take you home

He sits in a  corner  all alone

He  lives  under a waterfall

Nobody can see him

Nobody can ever hear him call

Nobody can ever hear him callThere's no need for you to say you're sorry

Goodbye I'm  going  home

I don't care no more so don't you worry

Goodbye I'm  going  home



I hate the way that even  though  you know you're wrong

You say you're right

I hate the  books  you read and all your friends

Your music's  shite  it  keeps  me up all night, up all night



There's no need for you to say you're sorry

Goodbye I'm  going  home

I don't care no more so don't you worry

Goodbye I'm  going  home



I hate the way that you are so sarcastic

And you're not very bright

You  think  that  everything  you've done's fantastic

Your music's  shite  it  keeps  me up all night, up all night



And it will be nice to be alone

For a week or two

But I know then I will be right

Right back here with you



There's no need for you to say you're sorry

Goodbye I'm  going  home

I don't care no more so don't you worry

Goodbye I'm  going  homeSing a sad song

In a  lonely  place

Try to put a word in from me

It's been so long 



Since I  found  this place

You  better  put in two or three

We as  people  are just  walking  'round

Our  heads  are  firmly  fixed in the ground



What we don't see

Well it can't be real

What we don't  touch  we  cannot  feel



Where we're  living  in this town

The sun is  coming  up and it's  going  down

But it's all just the same at the end of the day

And we  cheat  and we lie



Nobody says it's wrong

So we don't ask why

'Cause it's all just the same at the end of the day



We're  throwing  it all away

We're  throwing  it all away

We're  throwing  it all away at the end of the day



If you're needing

Something I can give

I know I'd help you if I can

If your  honest  and you say that you did



You know that I  would  give you my hand

Or a sad song

In a  lonely  place

I'll try to put a word in for you



Need a shoulder?  Well if that's the case

You know there's  nothing  I wouldn't do



Where we're  living  in this town

The sun is  coming  up and it's  going  down

But it's all just the same at the end of the day

When we  cheat  and we lie



Nobody says it's wrong

So we don't ask why

'Cause it's all just the same at the end of the day



Don't  throw  it all away

Don't  throw  it all away

Don't  throw  it all away

Don't  throw  it all away



Throwing it all away

Throwing it all away

Throwing it all away



Throwing it all away

Throwing it all away

You're  throwing  it all away at the end of the dayHere I  stand  with head in hand

I turn my face to the wall

If she's gone I can't go on

Feeling two foot small

Everywhere  people  stare

Each and  every  day

I can hear them  laugh  at me

And I hear them say



Hey you've got to hide your love away !

Hey you've got to hide your love away !



How can I even try ?

'cause I can  never  win

Seeing them  hearing  them

In the  state  I'm in

How  could  she say to me "Love will find a way" ?

Gather 'round all you clowns

Let me hear you say



Hey you've got to hide your love away !

Hey you've got to hide your love away !I'm free to be  whatever  I

Whatever I  choose  and I'll sing the  blues  if I want

I'm free to say  whatever  I

Whatever I like if it's  wrong  or  right  it's all right



Always  seems  to me

You  always  see what  people  want you to see

How long's it  gonna  be

Before we get on the bus and  cause  no fuss



Get a grip on  yourself  it don't cost much

Free to be  whatever  you

Whatever you say if it  comes  my way it's all right

You're free to be  wherever  you



Wherever you  please  you can  shoot  the  breeze  if you want

It  always  seems to me

You  always  see what  people  want you to see

How long's it  gonna  be



Before we get on the bus and  cause  no fuss

Get a grip on  yourself  it don't cost much

Free to be  whatever  I

Whatever I  choose  and I'll sing the  blues  if I want



Here in my mind

You know you  might  find

Something that you

You  thought  you once knew



But now it's all gone

And now it's no fun

Yeah now it's no fun

Oh now it's no fun



I'm free to be  whatever  I

Whatever I  choose  and I'll sing the  blues  if I want

I'm free to be  whatever  I

Whatever I  choose  and I'll sing the  blues  if I want



Whatever you do

Whatever you say yeah I know it's all right

Whatever you do

Whatever you say yeah I know it's all rightHow many  special  people change?

How many  lives  are  living  strange?

Where were you  while  we were  getting  high?



Slowly  walking  down the hall

Faster than a cannonball

Where were you  while  we were  getting  high?



Someday you will find me

Caught  beneath  the landslide

In a  champagne  supernova in the sky

Someday you will find me

Caught  beneath  the landslide

In a  champagne  supernova

A  champagne  supernova in the sky



Wake up the dawn and ask her why

A  dreamer  dreams, she  never  dies

Wipe that tear away now from your eye



Slowly  walking  down the hall

Faster than a cannonball

Where were you  while  we were  getting  high?



Someday you will find me

Caught  beneath  the landslide

In a  champagne  supernova in the sky

Someday you will find me

Caught  beneath  the landslide

In a  champagne  supernova

A  champagne  supernova



'Cause we don't believe

That they're  gonna  get away from the summer

But you and I will  never  die

The world's  still  spinning  around  we don't know why

Why, why, why, why



How many  special  people change?

There's no easy way out

The day's  moving  just too fast for me

I need some time in the sunshine

I  gotta  slow it  right  down

The day's  moving  just too fast for me



I live my life for the  stars  that shine

People say it's just a  waste  of time

Then they said I  should  feed my head

That to me was just a day in bed

I'll take my car and  drive  real far

They're not  concerned  about the way we are

In my mind my  dreams  are real

Now we're  concerned  about the way I feel



Tonight I'm a rock 'n' roll star

Tonight I'm a rock 'n' roll star

Flash your pen at the song that I'm  singing  



Touch down bass  living  on the run 



Make no  sweat  of the hole that you're  digging  



Wrap up cold when it's warm  outside  



Your shit  jokes  remind me of Digsy's 



Be my  magic  carpet ride 



Fly me down to  capitol  city in the sun 



Kickin' up a  storm  from the day that I was born 



Sing a song for me from let it be 



Open up yer eyes  get a grip of  yerself  inside 



You betcha!Step off the  train  all  alone  at dawn

Back into the hole  where  I was born

The sun in the sky  never  raised an eye to me

The  blood  on the tracks, and they must be mine

The fool on the hill, and I feel fine

Don't look back 'cause you know what you  might  see



Look into the wall of my mind's eye

I  think  I know, but I don't know why

The  questions  are the  answers  you  might  need

Coming in a mess,  going  out in style

I ain't good-looking, but I'm someone's child

No one can give me the air that's mine to breathe



I met my maker

I made him cry

And on my  shoulder  he  asked  me why

His  people  won't fly  through  the storm

I said  listen  up man, they don't even know you're born



All my  people  right here,  right  now

D'you know what I mean? Yeah, yeah

All my  people  right here,  right  now

D'you know what I mean? Yeah, yeah

All my  people  right here,  right  now

D'you know what I mean? Yeah, yeah

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah



I don't  really  care for what you believe

So open up your fist or you won't receive

The  thoughts  and the  words  of  every  man you'll need

Get up off the  floor  and  believe  in life

No one's ever  gonna  ever ask you twice

Get on the bus and  bring  it on home to me



I met my maker

I made him cry

And on my  shoulder  he  asked  me why

His  people  won't fly  through  the storm

I said "Listen up man, they don't even know you're born"



All my  people  right here,  right  now

They know what I mean yeah, yeah

All my  people  right here,  right  now

All my  people  right here,  right  now

D'you know what I mean? Yeah, yeah

Yeah, yeah

Yeah, yeah

Yeah, yeah

Yeah, yeahA cold and  frosty  morning there's not a lot to say

About the  things  caught in my mind

As the day was  dawning  my  plane  flew away

With all the  things  caught in my mind

And I want to be  there  when you're

Coming down



And I want to be  there  when you hit the ground

So don't go away, say what you say

But say that you'll stay

Forever and a day in the time of my life

'Cause I need more time, yes, I need more time

Just to make  things  right



Damn my  situation  and the  games  I have to play

With all the  things  caught in my mind



Damn my  education  I can't find the  words  to say

About all the  things  caught in my mind



And I want to be  there  when you're

Coming down



And I want to be  there  when you hit the ground

So don't go away, say what you say

But say that you'll stay

Forever and a day in the time of my life

'Cause I need more time, yes, I need more time

Just to make  things  right



Me and you what's  going  on?

All we seem to know is how to show

The  feelings  that are wrong



So don't go away, say what you say

But say that you'll stay

Forever and a day in the time of my life

'Cause I need more time, yes, I need more time

Just to make  things  right



So don't go away, say what you say

But say that you'll stay

Forever and a day in the time of my life

'Cause I need more time, yes, I need more time

Just to make  things  right

Yes, I need more time

Just to make  things  right

Yes, I need more time

Just to make  things  right

So don't go awayGet on the rollercoaster

The fair's in town today

You've  gotta  be 

Bad  enough  to beat the  brave  



So get on the  helter  skelter

Bowl into the fray

You've  gotta  be 

Bad  enough  to beat the  brave  



You fade in-out

You fade in-out

Without a doubt

I don't see no shine



Today is just a daydream

Tomorrow we'll be  castaway  

Coming in-out of nowhere

Singin' rhapsody



You've  gotta  be 

Bad  enough  to want to be 

Sitting  upside  a high chair

The devil's refugee



Is  gonna  be  blinded  by the light

That  follows  me 

She fade in-out

She fade in-out



Without a doubt

I don't see no shine

Today is just a daydream

Tomorrow she'll be  castaway  



We fade in-out

We fade in-out

Without a doubt

I don't see no shine



Today is just a daydream

Tomorrow we'll be  castaway  

Get on the rollercoaster

The fair's in town today



You've  gotta  be 

Bad  enough  to beat the  brave  

Get on the  helter  skelter

Step into the fray



You've  gotta  be 

Bad  enough  to beat the  brave  

You're  fading  out

You're  fading  outIf I may be so bold that I  could  say  something  

Come and make me my day 

The  clouds  around your soul don't  gather  there for  nothing  

I can  chase  them all away 

Why do you need a  reason  for to feel  happy  

Or  shining  for the rest of the  world  

Give me just a  smile  and  would  you make it  snappy  

Get your shit  together  girl 

You got a  feeling  lost  inside  

It just won't let you go 

Life is  sneaking  up  behind  

It just won't let you go 

No it just won't let you go 

Is what I'm  trying  to say

Is  would  you maybe, come  dancing  with me 

'Cause to me it doesn't  matter  

If your  hopes  and  dreams  are  shattered  

'Cause when you say  something  you make me  believe  

In the girl who  wears  a  dirty  shirt 

She  knows  exactly what she's  worth  

Knows  exactly  what she's  worth  to me! 

That I can see, I can see 

If you ever find  yourself  inside a  bubble  

You've  gotta  make your own way home 

You can call me  anytime  you're  seeing  double 

Now you know you're not aloneThey're  trying  hard to put me in my place

And that is why I  gotta  keep running

The future's mine and its no disgrace

'Cause in the end the past  means  nothing



You tell me I'm free then you tie me down

And from my  chains  I  think  it's a pity

What did it cost you to wear my crown?

You don't like me, why don't you  admit  it?



I feel a  little  down today

And I ain't got much to say

But you're  gonna  miss me when I'm not there

And you know I don't care, you know I don't care



As we beg and  steal  and borrow

Life is hit and miss and this

I Hope, I Think, I Know

And if I ever hear the  names  you call

And if I  stumble  catch me when I fall

'cause baby  after  all, you'll  never  forget my name



You're  trying  hard to put me in my place

And that is why I  gotta  keep running

The future's mine and its no disgrace

'Cause in the end your life  means  nothing



D'you feel a  little  down today?

Bet you ain't got much to say?

Who's  gonna  miss you when you're not there?

You know we don't care, you know we don't careSay  something  shout it from the  rooftops  of your head

Make it sort of mean  something  make me understand

Or I'll forget

The  people  here on life's beaches

They wish upon the  waves  that hide the sand

Let them know that life  teaches  you

To  build  a  castle  in your hand



Maybe the  songs  that we sing are wrong

Maybe the  dreams  that we  dream  are gone

So  bring  it on home and it won't be long

It's gettin'  better  man!



[Chorus]

Hey! What was that you said to me?

Jus' say the word and I'd be free?

And  where  the  stars  are  shining  bright

It's gettin'  better  man!

And  crashing  in upon a wave

It's  calling  out  beyond  the grave

And we're the fire in the sky

It's gettin'  better  man!



Build  something  build a  better  place and call it home

Even if it  means  nothing you'll never-ever feel that you're aloneAn  extra  ordinary guy 



Can  never  have an  ordinary  day 



He  might  live the long  goodbye  



But that is not for me to say 



I dig his  friends   I dig his  shoes   



He is just a  child  with  nothing  to lose 



In  their  minds   their  minds 



But I'll have my way 



In my own time 



I'll have my say 



My star will  shine  



'cause you see me I got my  Magic  Pie. 



Think of me yeah that was me I was that  passer  by 



I've been and now I've gone 



There are but a  thousand  days  preparing  for a  thousand  years, 



Many  minds  to  educate  the  people  who have  disappeared  



D'you dig my friends? D'you dig my shoes? 



I am like a  child  with  nothing  to lose 



My mindMade a meal and  threw  it up on  Sunday  I've
Gotta lot of  things  to learn
Said I  would  and I'll be  leaving  one day
Before my  heart  starts to burn

So what's the  matter  with you?
Sing me  something  new...don't you know
The cold and wind and rain don't know
They only seem to come and go away

Times are hard when  things  have got no meaning
I've  found  a key upon the floor
Maybe you and I will not  believe  in the  things  we find
Behind the door

Stand by me...nobody  knows  the way it's  gonna  be
Stand by me...nobody  knows  the way it's  gonna  be
Stand by me...nobody  knows  the way it's  gonna  be

If you're  leaving  will you take me with you
I'm  tired  of  talking  on my phone
There is one  thing  I can  never  give you
My  heart  will  never  be your homeEverybody knows

But no-one's  saying  nothing

And it's a  sound  so very loud

That no-one can hear

I got  something  in my  shoes  it's  keeping  me from walking

Down the long and  winding  road back home to you 



Around this town you've  ceased  to be

That's what you get for  sleeping  with the enemy

Where  angels  fly you won't play

So  guess  who's  gonna  take the  blame  



For my big mouth, my big name

I'll put on my  shoes  while they're  walking  slowly down the hall of fame?

Into my big  mouth  you  could  fly a plane

I'll put on my  shoes  while they're  walking  slowly down the hall of fame?

Slowly down the hall of fame 



I ain't  never  spoke to God

And I ain't  never  been to heaven

But you  assumed  I knew the way

Even  though  the map was given

And as you look into the eyes

Of a  bloody  cold assassin

Is only then you'll realize

With who's life you have been messin'



Around this town you've  ceased  to be

That's what you get for  sleeping  with the enemy

Where  angels  fly you won't play

So  guess  who's  gonna  take the  blame  



For my big mouth, my big name

Who'll put on my  shoes  while they're walking

Slowly down the hall of fame?

Into my big  mouth  you  could  fly a plane

I'll put on my  shoes  while they're  walking  slowly down the hall of fame

Slowly down the hall of fame (fame, fame)

Slowly down the hall of fame (fame, fame)



And  round  this town, you've  ceased  to be

That's what you get for  sleeping  with the enemy

Where  angels  fly you won't play

I  guess  who's  going  to take the  blame  



For my big mouth, my big name

I'll put on my  shoes  while I'm  walking  slowly down the hall of fame

Into my big mouth, yeah you  could  fly a plane

I'll put on my  shoes  while I'm walking



Slowly down the hall of fame (fame, fame)

Slowly down the hall of fame (fame, fame)

Slowly down the hall of fame (fame, fame)Everybody knows

But no-one's  saying  nothing

Slowly down the hall of fame (fame, fame)

Slowly down the hall of fame (fame, fame)

Slowly down the hall of fame (fame, fame)Won't you take me

Won't you take me to the edge of  night  and make me

Won't you make me walk into the light

And there'll be no eyes

No eyes that see such  beauty  would lose  their  sight

And there'll be no lies

No lies that you  could  tell me to make  things  right



'cause I gave all my  money  to  people  and things

And the  price  I'm  still  playing for the shit that it brings

Doesn't fill me with hope for the  songs  that you sing

Tonight this is your life

Angel child



When you find out

When you find out who you are you know you'll be free

To see your own ability

But there'll be no eyes

No eyes that see such  beauty  could lose  their  sight

And there'll be no lies

No lies that you  could  tell me to make  things  right



'cause I gave all my  money  to  people  and things

And the  price  I'm  still  playing for the shit that it brings

Doesn't fill me with hope for the  songs  that you sing

Tonight this is your life

Angel child

Tonight this is your life, this is your life

Angel  child  of mine



Tonight this is your life, this is your life

Angel child

Tonight this is your life, this is your life

Angel  child  of mine

This is your life, this is your life

Angel child

Tonight this is your life, this is your life

Angel childI, I will be king

And you, you will be queen

Though nothing, will  drive  them away

We can beat them, just for one day

We can be heroes, just for one day



And you, you can be mean

And I, I'll  drink  all the time

'Cause we're lovers, and that is a fact

Yes we're lovers, and that is that



Though nothing, will keep us together

We  could  steal time, just for one day

We can be heroes,  forever  and ever

What'd you say?



I, I wish you  could  swim

Like the dolphins, like  dolphins  can swim

Though nothing,  nothing  will keep us together

We can beat them,  forever  and ever

Oh, we can be heroes, just for one day



I, I will be king

And you, you will be queen

Though nothing, will  drive  them away

We can be heroes, just for one day

We can be us, just for one day



I, I can  remember  (I remember)

Standing, by the wall (by the wall)

And the guns, shot  above  our  heads  (over our heads)

And we kissed, as  though  nothing  could  fall (nothing  could  fall)

And the shame, was on the  other  side

Oh, we can beat them,  forever  and ever

Then we  could  be heroes, just for one day



We can be heroes

We can be heroes

We can be heroes

Just for one day

We can be heroes



We're nothing, and  nothing  will help us

Maybe we're lying, then you  better  not stay

But we  could  be safer, just for one day

Oh-oh-oh-ohh, oh-oh-oh-ohh, just for one dayOne way out is all you're ever  going  to get
From  those  who'll hand it out don't  never  let it  upset  you
'cause they'll put  words  into your mouths

They're  making  you feel so ashamed
Making you  taking  the blame
Making you cold in the night
Making you  question  your  heart  and your soul
And I  think  that it's not  quite  right

Hey !  Stay  young  and  invincible  !
'cause we know just what we are
And come what may we're unstoppable
'cause we know just what we are
Yeah we know just what we are
Yeah we know just what we are

Feed your head with all the  things  you need
When you're hungry
Stay in bed and  sleep  all day as long as it's Sunday
'cause they'll put  words  into my mouth

They're  making  me feel so ashamed
Making me  taking  the blame
Making me cold in the night
Making me  question  my  heart  and my soul
And I  think  that it's not  quite  right

Hey !  Stay  young  and  invincible  !
'cause we know just what we are
And come what may we're unstoppable
'cause we know just what we are
Yeah we know just what we are
Yeah we know just what we are

Hey !  Stay  young  and  invincible  !
'cause we know just what we are
And come what may we're unstoppable
'cause we know just what we are
And hey !  Stay  young  and  invincible  !
'cause we know just what we are
And come what may my faith's unshakeable
'cause we know just what we are
'cause we know just what we are
'cause we know just what we are
'cause we know just what we are
'cause we know just what we are
Know just what we are
Know just what we are
Know just what we are
Know just what we areBreaks like glass

But not in your hand

They'll  shoot  you down

Right  where  you stand

And it don't care for what you wear

Or  which  way you  might  sway

It  calls  you up

But not on the phone

And it will drag you from your  throne  



And you may  laugh  while you sit there

Sipping your champagne

And may I  laugh  at your despair

Sniffing your cocaine

I'm a man of  choice  in an old  Rolls  Royce

And I'm  howling  at the moon

Is my  happening  to deafening

For you ?

For you ? 



It's  maybe  The Fame

It's for  calling  your name

It's sees you crying

Never did explain

Am I the name

Blowing  through  you

Like a  hurricane  



It's a shame

It's a shame

It's a  shame  



It will not fall

Not from the sky

And it don't eat no  humble  pie

And you may have your  quiet  life

But I bet you don't know why

It  makes  you a mess

You didn't believe

You  still  don't know what  makes  me  breathe  



And you may  laugh  while you sit there

Sipping your champagne

And may I  laugh  at your despair

While you're  sniffing  your cocaine

I'm a man of  choice  in an old  Rolls  Royce

And I'm  howling  at the moon

Is this  happening  to deafening

For you ?

For you ? 



It's  maybe  The Fame

For  calling  your name

It's sees you cry

You  never  did explain

Am I the name

Blowing  through  you

Like a  hurricane  



It's a shame

It's a shame

It's a  shame  



It's  maybe  The Fame

For  calling  your name

It's sees you cry

You  never  did explain

Am I the name

Blowing  through  you

Like a  hurricane  



And I've  walked  out on your name

It sees you cry

Up from the sky

You  never  did explain

Why I'm  still  

Blowing  through  you

Like a hurricaneEverywhere I hear the  sound  of  marching  feet, boy

Cause summer's here and the time is  right  for  fighting  in the street, boy

But what can a poor boy do

'Cept to sing for a rock 'n' roll band

Cause in  sleepy  London town

There's just no  place  for a  street  fighting man

No ! 



Hey !   Think  the time is  right  for a  palace  revolution

But  where  I live the game to play is  compromise  solution

Well, what can a poor boy do

'Cept to sing for a rock 'n' roll band

Cause in  sleepy  London town

There's just no  place  for a  street  fighting man

No !  No !  No ! 

Get down !



Hey !  Said my name is  called  disturbance

I'll  shout  and scream, I'll kill the king, I'll rail at all his servants

Well, what can a poor boy do

'Cept to sing in a rock 'n' roll band

Cause in  sleepy  London town

There's just no  place  for a  street  fighting man

No !  No !  No !Hate the way that you've  taken  back

Everything you've  given  to me

And the way that you'd  always  say

It's  nothing  to do with me

Different  versions  of many men

Come  before  you came

All  their  questions was similar

The  answers  just the same



I'm  gonna  get me a  motor  car

Maybe a  Jaguar  maybe a  plane  or a day of fame

I'm  gonna  be a  millionaire  so can you take me there

want to be wild 'cause my life's so tame

Here am I,  going  nowhere on a train

Here am I,  growing  older in the rain

Hey hey hey hey



Hate the way that you've  taken  back

Everything you've  given  to me

Any way that you  always  say

It's  nothing  to do with me

Different  versions  of many men

Come  before  you came

All  their  questions was similar

The  answers  just the same



I'm  gonna  get me a  motor  car

Maybe a  Jaguar  maybe a  plane  or a day of fame

I'm  gonna  be a  millionaire  so can you take me there

want to be wild 'cause my life's so same

Here am I,  going  nowhere on a train

Here am I,  growing  older in the rain

Here am I,  going  nowhere on a train

Here am I,  getting  lost and  lonely  sad and only

Why  sometimes  does my life feel so tame ?

Hey hey hey heyTake the time to make some sense
Of what you want to say
And cast your  words  away upon the waves

And sail them home with acquiesce
On a ship of hope today
And as they land upon the shore
Tell them not to fear no more
Say it loud, and sing it  proud  today

And then  dance  if you  wanna  dance
Please  brother  take a chance
You know they're  gonna  go
Which way they  wanna  go
All we know is that we don't
Know how it's  gonna  be
Please  brother  let it be
Life on the  other  hand
Won't make us understand
We're all part of the masterplan

Say it loud and sing it  proud  today

I'm not  saying  right is wrong
It's up to us to make
The best of all the things
That come our way

'cause  everything  that's been has passed
The answer's in the  looking  glass
There's four and  twenty  million doors
On life's  endless  corridor
Say it loud and sing it  proud  today

We'll  dance  if they  wanna  dance
Please  brother  take a chance
You know they're  gonna  go
Which way they  wanna  go
All we know is that we don't
Know how it's  gonna  be
Please  brother  let it be
Life on the  other  hand
Won't make you understand
We're all part of the masterplanSpend you days just  walking  and shopping

Depending on how much you're luck is in

Spend the night-life table-hopping

And  trying  to keep that bag of  bones  in trim



I don't mind not  being  immortal

''cause it ain't all that as far as I can tell

I don't mind not  going  to heaven

As long as they've got cigarettes

As long as they've got  cigarettes  in hell



And by the time we  start  getting used to it

The dope that's  forming  on the windowsill

Now we know we've got  ourselves  into

The cage that  keeps  the mice on the treadmill



I don't mind not  being  immortal

''cause it ain't all that as far as I can tell

I don't mind not  going  to heaven

As long as they've got cigarettes

As long as they've got  cigarettes  in hell



I don't mind not  being  immortal

Because it ain't all that as far as I can tell

I don't mind not  going  to heaven

As long as they've got cigarettes

As long as they've got  cigarettes  in hellWe put this  festival  on you bastards, with a  lotta  love.

We  worked  one year for you pigs

And you want to  break  our  walls  down?

And you want to  destroy  us?

Well you go to hell!



Kids are  running  around naked, fuckin? in the bushes.

Kids are  running  around naked, fuckin? in the bushes.

Kids are  running  around naked, fuckin? in the bushes.

Kids are  running  around naked, fuckin? in the bushes.



I love it!

Ah, ah, ah ah

Ah, ah, ah ah



Kids are  running  around naked, fuckin? in the bushes.

Kids are  running  around naked, fuckin? in the bushes.

Kids are  running  around naked, fuckin? in the bushes.

Kids are  running  around naked, fuckin? in the bushes.



I love it! Room for  everybody  here

Yes, all are welcome!

Yes indeed, I love them!

Fun! Nice! Life! Youths! Beautiful!

I'm all for it



I love it! Room for  everybody  here

Yes, all are welcome!

Yes indeed, I love them!

Fun! Nice! Life! Youths! Beautiful!

I'm all for itWhat  tongueless  ghost of sin  crept  through my curtains?

Sailing on a sea of  sweat  on a  stormy  night

I  think  he don't got a name but I can't be certain

And in me he  starts  to  confide  



That my  family  don't seem so familiar

And my  enemies  all know my name

And if you hear me tap on your window

Better get on yer  knees  and pray  panic  is on the way 



My  pulse  pumps out a beat to the  ghost  dancer

My eyes are dead and my throat's like a  black  hole

And if there's a god  would  he give  another  chancer

An hour to sing for his soul 



'cause my  family  don't seem so familiar

And my  enemies  all know my name

And when you hear me tap on yer window

Yer  better  get on yer  knees  and pray  panic  is on the way 



'cause my  family  don't seem so familiar

And my  enemies  all know my name

And when you hear me tap on yer window

Then you get on your  knees  and you  better  pray

'cause my  family  don't seem so familiar

And my  enemies  all know my name

And when you hear me tap on your window

Yer  better  get on yer  knees  and pray

Panic is on the way

Panic is on the wayPaint no illusion, try to  click  with  whatcha  got
Taste  every  potion 'cause if yer like  yerself  a lot
Go let it out, go let it in, go let it out

Life is  precocious  in a most  peculiar  way
Sister  psychosis  don't got a lot to say
She go let it out, she go let it in, she go let it out
She go let it out, she go let it in, she go let it out

Is it any  wonder  why  Princes  & Kings
Are  clowns  that  caper  in  their  sawdust rings
Ordinary  people  that are like you and me
We're the  keepers  of  their  destiny,
We're the  keepers  of  their  destiny

I'm goin'  leaving  this city, I'm goin' drivin'  outta  town
And your comin' with me the  right  time is  always  now
To go let it out, to go let it in, and go let it out
To go let it out, to go let it in, and go let it out

Is it any  wonder  why  Princes  and Kings
Are  clowns  that  caper  in  their  sawdust rings
Ordinary  people  that are like you and me
We're the  builders  of  their  destiny
We're the  builders  of  their  destiny
We're the  builders  of  their  destiny
We're the  builders  of  their  destiny

So go let it out, go let it in
Go let it out, don't let it in
Go let it out, go let it in
Go let it out, don't let it, don't let it in, don't let it inBaby the time is  right  to tell it all like it is

And now that I feel god like there's  nothing  that can't be kissed

The name of a  lonely  soul is  scratched  into my brain

He  thought  he was king creole

Until he  found  out,  until  he  found  out 



He sits upon a throne

He  lives  a  sleazy  lie

But he's all  alone  again,  again  



I can see a liar,  sitting  by the fire

Trouble in his heart,  laughing  at the thought

Coming as he goes into overdose

I  wonder  what he  thinks  of me?Is  anyone  here  prepared  to say

Just what they mean or is it too late ?

For  anyone  here to try to do

Just what it  takes  to get  through  to you 



So let's all make believe

That we're  still  friends and we like each other

Let's all make believe

In the end we're  gonna  need each  other  



Stradle my hope and make me pray

To a God I've  never  seen, but who I've betrayed

To the  people  who live the afterlife

In a  place  I'll  never  be 'til I'm  crucified  



So let's all make believe

We're  still  friends and we like each other

Let's all make believe

In the end we'll need each  other  



Let's all make believe

That all mankind's  gonna  feed our brother

Let's all make believe

That in the end we'll all grow up 



So let's all make believe

That we're  still  friends and we like each other

Let's all make believe

In the end we'll need each  other  



Let's all make believe

That all mankind's  gonna  feed our brother

Let's all make believe

That in the end we'll all grow upLittle James, we're all the same

They  always  seem to look to us

But we weren't  meant  to be  grown  ups

Thank you for your smile

You make it all  worthwhile  to us 



You live for your toys, even  though  they make noise

Have you ever  played  with plastercine

Or even  tried  a trampoline

Thank you for your smile

You make it all  worthwhile  to us 



I'm  singing  this song for you and your mum that's all

'cause it won't be long  before  everyone is gone



Sailed out to sea, your mum you and me

You swam the  ocean  like a child

Life  around  us was so wild

Thank you for your smile

You make it all  worthwhile  to us 



I'm  singing  this song for you and your mum that's all

And it won't be long  before  everyone is gonePut yer  money  where yer  mouth  is

Yer  mamma  says that you was real

Put yer  money  where yer  mouth  is

Yer  mamma  says that you was real 



Ready or not, come what may

The bets are  going  down for  judgement  day

So put yer  money  in yer mouth

And your  hands  right upon the  wheel  



Put yer  money  where yer  mouth  is

Yer  pappa  says that you was real

Put yer  money  where yer  mouth  is

Yer  pappa  says that you was real 



Ready or not, and come what may

You  betcha  going down on  judgement  day

So put yer  money  in yer mouth

And yer  hands  right upon the wheelI can give a  hundred  million reasons

To  build  a barricade

I  blame  it on the  changing  of the seasons

The  thoughts  that I've  conveyed  



Does it make it all right?

It doesn't make it all  right  



To roll it over my soul and  leave  me here

Roll it over my soul and  leave  me here 



Look  around  at all the  plastic  people

Who live  without  a care

Try to sit with me  around  my table

But  never  bring a  chair  



And in your head do you feel

What you're not  supposed  to feel

You take what you want

But you won't get it for free

You need more time

'cause your  thoughts  and  words  won't last  forever  more

But I'm not sure if it ever  works  out right

But it's ok. It's all  right  



And in your head do you feel

What you're not  supposed  to feel

When you take what you want

You don't get hope for free

You need more time

'cause your  thoughts  and  words  won't last  forever  more

And I'm not sure if it'll ever, ever, ever work out right

Will it ever, ever, ever work out right?

'cause it never, never,  never  works out rightHere's  another  Sunday  morning  call

Yer hear yer head-a-banging on the door

Slip your  shoes  on and then out you crawl

Into a day that couldn't give you more

But what for? 



And in your head do you feel

What you're not  supposed  to feel

You take what you want

But you won't get it for free

You need more time

'cause your  thoughts  and  words  won't last  forever  more

But I'm not sure if it ever  works  out right

But it's ok. It's all  right  



When yer  lonely  and you  start  to hear

The  little  voices in your head at night

You will only  sniff  away the tears

So you can  dance  until the  morning  light

At what price?You know that  feeling  you get

You feel you´re  older  than time

You ain´t  exactly  sure

If you´ve been away a while



Do you keep the receipts

For the  friends  that you buy

And ain´t it bittersweet

You were only just  getting  by



But I hope you know

That it won´t let go

It  sticks  around with you  until  the day you die

And i hope you know that it´s  touch  and go

I hope the  tears  don´t  stain  the  world  that  waits  outside

Where did it all go wrong?



And  until  you´ve heard

The  dreams  you  bought  for your lies

You´ll be castaway

Alone  under  the  stormy  skies



But I hope you know

That it won´t let go

It  sticks  around with you  until  the day you die

And i hope you know that it´s  touch  and go

I hope the  tears  don´t  stain  the  world  that  waits  outside

Where did it all go wrong?Found what I'd lost inside
My  spirit  has been purified
Take a  thorn  from my pride
And hand in hand we'll take a walk outside

Thank you for the sun the one that  shines  on everyone
Who  feels  love
Now there's a  million  years  between  my  fantasies  & fears
I feel love

I'm  leaving  all that I see
Now all my  emotions  fill the air I breath

Now you  understand  that this is not the  promised  land
They  spoke  of
There's  nothing  more to be
If you can be the  remedy  who  heals  loveWe put this  festival  on you bastards, with a  lotta  love.

We  worked  one year for you pigs

And you want to  break  our  walls  down?

And you want to  destroy  us?

Well you go to hell!

Where did it all go wrong?I want to get high, but I  never  could take the pain

'Cause it  would  blow away my soul like a hurricane

Like a one man band  clapping  in the  pouring  rain

If I know  where  I'm going, I don't know from  where  I came 



Where we  gonna  be in summertime?

And are we  gonna  see the  heavens  shine

Like  diamonds  in the sky? 



As soon as they come

The  feelings  they go

All alone, on a one way road 



As soon as they come

Yeah !  Ah yeah !  AhBorn on a  different  cloud 

From the ones that have  burst  'round town 

It's no  surprise  to me 

That you're classless,  clever  and free



Loaded just like a gun 

You're the hero that's  still  unsung 

Living on  borrowed  time 

You're my sun, and you're  gonna  shine 



Talking to  myself  again 

This time I  think  I'm  getting  through 

It's  funny  how you  think  

It's  funny  how, it's  funny  how when you do...



Born on a  different  cloud 

From the ones that have  burst  round town 

It's no  surprise  to me 

That you're classless,  clever  and free



Lonely soul 

Busy  working  overtime 

Nothing ever gets done 

Especially when your  hands  are tied 



Lonely soul

Baking up your mother's  pride  

Nothing ever gets done 

Not  until  your war's won



Born on a  different  cloud 

You're born on a  different  cloud 

Born on a  different  cloud 

Born on a  different  cloud 

Born on a  different  cloud 

Born on a  different  cloud 

Born on a  different  cloud 

Born on a  different  cloud



Na na na na na na naYeah I feel like a  force  of  nature  

Could make you sing like a bird  released  

If what you seek is the wise man's  treasure  

You know it's  buried  beneath your feet 

You know you look like a  painted  picture 

I see the  cracks  freezing on your skin 

And as the  world  slowly  turns  and hits you 

That the  thieves  of the  night  

Are  coming  to take you in 



For  smoking  all my  stash  

But  burning  all my cash 

I bet you knew  right  away 

It's all over town that 

The sun's  going  down 

On the days of your easy life



I bet you knew  right  away 

You dope you don't know  where  it's at 

It's all over town 

That the sun's gone down 

And it's high time to pray



Yeah I feel like a  force  of  nature  

Could make you sing like a bird  released  

If what you seek is the wise man's treasure

You know it's  buried  beneath your feet 

You know you look like a  faded  picture 

I see the  cracks  frozen on your skin 

As the  world  slowly  turns  and hits you 

Then the  thieves  of the  night  

Are  coming  to take you in 



For  smoking  all my  stash  

But  burning  all my cash 

I bet you knew  right  away 

It's all over town that 

The sun's  going  down 

On the days of your easy life



I bet you knew  right  away 

You dope you don't know  where  it's at 

It's all over if you're  begging  me  please  

Then yer get on your  knees  and pray



Yer  smoking  all my  stash  

Yer  burning  all my cash 

I bet you knew  right  away 

It's all over town that 

The sun's gone down 

And it's high time to prayI get up when I'm down

I can't swim but my soul won't drown

I do  believe  I got flare

I got  speed  and I walk on air



'Cause God  gimme  soul in your rock'n'roll, babe

'Cause God  gimme  soul in your rock'n'roll, babe

And I get so high I just can't feel it

And I get so high I just can't feel it



In and out my brain

You're runnin'  through  my vein

You're my  sunshine  

You're my rain



There's a  light  that  shines  on

Shines on me and it  keeps  me warm

It  gimme  peace I must say

I can't  sleep  'cause the  world  won't wait



'Cause God  gimme  soul in your rock'n'roll, babe

'Cause God  gimme  soul in your rock'n'roll, babe

And I get so high I just can't feel it

You're runnin'  through  my vein

You're my  sunshine  

You're my rainI can go  where  I want to 

Be who I want to be now 

I can  sleep  under  water  

Never  worried  what I'm  gonna  dream now 



Yeah, the time's come and gone 

And I know  where  I'm from 

And can be so

It's  hasta  mañana 

You're on your own  banana  skin feet now 



Yeah, I've been hung in a bad  place  

Had no sun over my face 

I've been hung in a bad  place  

For too long 

 

I can say what I want to 

Feel how I want to feel now 

I can  squeeze  all the  hours  

I  choose  to  devour  with ease now 



I can sing to the  trees  

Tarzan on  harmonies  for free, yeah 

You've been blocked, and you're  stalling  

Nature is  calling  for me 

You got me!



Yeah, I've been hung in a bad  place  

Had no sun over my face 

I've been hung in a bad  place  

For too long 



Yeah, I've been hung in a bad  place  

Had no sun over my face 

I've been hung in a bad  place  

For too long, for too long, for too long

For too long, for too long, for too long

For too long, for too long, for too longWe the  people  fight for our existence
We don't  claim  to be  perfect  but we're free
We  dream  our  dreams  alone with no resistance
Fading like the  stars  we wish to be

You know I didn't mean what I just said
But my God woke up on the  wrong  side of his bed
And it just don't  matter  now

As  little  by  little  we gave you  everything  you ever  dreamed  of
Little by  little  the  wheels  of your life have  slowly  fallen off
Little by  little  you have to give it all in all your life
And all the time I just ask  myself  why you're  really  here?

True  perfection  has to be imperfect
I know that that  sounds  foolish but it's true
Day has come, now you'll have to accept
Life  inside  your head we give to you

You know I didn't mean what I just said
But my God woke up on the  wrong  side of his bed
And it just don't  matter  now

As  little  by  little  we gave you  everything  you ever  dreamed  of
Little by  little  the  wheels  of your life have  slowly  fallen off
Little by  little  you have to give it all in all your life
And all the time I just ask  myself  why you're  really  here?

As  little  by  little  we gave you  everything  you ever  dreamed  of
Little by  little  the  wheels  of your life have  slowly  fallen off
Little by  little  you have to give it all in all your life
And all the time I just ask  myself  why you're  really  here?

Why am I  really  here?
Why am I  really  here?Oh when the  sunshine  beckons to ya 

And your  wings  begin to  unfold  

The  thoughts  you  bring  and the  songs  you sing 

Are  gonna  keep me from the cold 



And if the  sword  is here  among  ya 

And its  words  may  wound  my soul 

You can fill me up with what you've got

'Cause my heart's been keepin' on



She is love 

And her ways are high and  steep  

She is love 

And I  believe  her when she speaks

Love 

And her ways are high and  steep  

She is love 

And I believe, I do  believe  her when she speaks



You're in all my  thoughts  of  passion  

And the  dreams  of my  delight  

Whatever  stirs  my  mortal  frame 

Will you keep it warm at  night  



I don't know  where  you come from 

No I haven't got a clue 

All I know is I'm in love 

With  someone  who  loves  me too



She is love 

And her ways are high and  steep  

She is love 

And I  believe  her when she speaks

Love 

And her ways are high and  steep  

She is love 

And I believe, I do  believe  her when she speaks



She is love 

And her ways are high and  steep  

She is love 

And I  believe  her when she speaks

She is love 

And her ways are high and  steep  

She is love 

And I believe, I do  believe  her when she speaks

I do  believe  her when she speaks

I do  believe  her when she speaks

I do  believe  her when she speaksTalking to the  songbird  yesterday
Flew me to a past not far away
She's a  little  pirate in my mind
Singing  songs  of love to pass the time

Gonna  write  a song so she can see
Give her all the love she  gives  to me
Talk of  better  days that have yet to come
Never felt this love from anyone

She's not anyone
She's not anyone
She's not anyone

A man can  never  dream  these  kind of things
Especially when she came and  spread  her wings
Whispered in my ear the  things  I'd like
Then she flew away into the night

Gonna  write  a song so she can see
Give her all the love she  gives  to me
Talk of  better  days that have yet to come
Never felt this love from anyone

She's not anyone
She's not anyone
She's not anyoneMy  heart  it  skips  a beat when I behold

The  light  that's  shining  through your eyes of gold

From  heavenly  blood you seem to spring

From  heavenly  waters you can drink



I'll meet you on a day that  never  ends

I'll  greet  you in a way that  heaven  meant

You lay me down  gently  on the leaves

You  cover  me over in my sleep



I  never  did say that I wish I could

I  never  could pray 'cause it's just no good

I hope you don't  break  my  heart  of stone

I don't want to  scream  out loud



And wake up on my own

And as I  close  my eyes

And the sky  turns  red

I  realize  just what you are



You're an idler's dream

And you're  singing  Shangri-La



Shangri-La

Shangri-La

Shangri-LaIt's nine o'clock

I'm  getting  tired

I'm sick of all my records

And the  clothes  I  bought  today



Am I  cracking  up

Or just  getting  older ?



I'm  staying  in

I can't be bothered

Making  conversation  with the friends

That I don't know



Am I  cracking  up 

Or just  getting  older ?



And I bet that this is how life

Turns out when you're  finally  grown

And you know if this is my life

I'll sit  around  all day and I'll moan



I'm half way up to the bottom

Of  another  bottle of my next best  favourite  friend



I'm not  cracking  up

I'm just  getting  older



No I'm not  cracking  up

I'm just  getting  older

I'm just  getting  olderHold up

It  would  be so nice to hear you say

"Thank you for the good times" 

Before the good  times  fly away

Your eyes 

Are  telling  lies

Some of the  stories  on the way

But it's so nice 

But don't let the good  times  fly away



I  drink  to  every  sucker  standing  here

Among the few who try and  cheat  the  years  

There's  always  one of us who's  blown  away

Or  strapped  and  stopped  for  breath  along the way

Talkin' 'bout my generationWhen I was young
I  thought  I had my own key
I knew exactly
What I  wanted  to be
Now I'm sure
You've  boarded  up  every  door

Lived in a bubble
Days were  never  ending
Was not concerned
About what life was sending
Fantasy was real
Now I know much  about  the way I feel

I'll  paint  you the picture
'Cause I don't think
You live  round  here no more
I've  never  even seen
The key to the door
We only get what we will  settle  for

While we're living
The  dreams  we have as  children  fade away
While we're living
The  dreams  we have as  children  fade away
While we're living
The  dreams  we have as  children  fade away
While we're living
The  dreams  we have as  children  fade away away away
They fade away away away

Now my life has turned
Another corner
I  think  it's only best
That I  should  warn you
Dream it  while  you can
Maybe  someday  I'll make you understand

I'll  paint  you the picture
'Cause I don't think
You live  round  here no more
I've  never  even seen
The key to the door
We only get what we will  settle  for

While we're living
The  dreams  we have as  children  fade away
While we're living
The  dreams  we have as  children  fade away
While we're living
The  dreams  we have as  children  fade away
While we're living
The  dreams  we have as  children  fade away away away
They fade away away away
They fade away away away
Fade away away awayI am he as you are he as you are me

(Oh I'm tired,  servicible  villain

Set you down father, rest you)What a life it  would  be 

If you  would  come to mine for tea 

I'll pick you up at half past  three  

We'll have  lasagna  



I'll  treat  you like a  Queen  

I'll give you  strawberries  and  cream  

Then your  friends  will all go  green  

For my  lasagna  



These  could  be the best days of our  lives  

But I don't  think  we've been  living  very wise 

Oh no, no

For my lasagnaI  would  like to  leave  this city

This old town don't  smell  too  pretty  and

I can feel the  warning  signs  running  around my mind

And when I  leave  this  island  I'll book  myself  into a soul asylum

'Cause I can feel the  warning  signs  running  around my mind



So here I go, I'm  still  scratching  around  in the same old hole

My body  feels  young but my mind is very old

So what do you say?

You can't give me the  dreams  that are mine anyway

Half the  world  away, half the  world  away

Half the  world  away

I've been lost, I've been  found  but I don't feel down



And when I  leave  this planet

You know I'd stay but I just can't  stand  it and

I can feel the  warning  signs  running  around my mind

And if I  could  leave this spirit

I'll find me a hole and I will live in it and

I can feel the  warning  signs  running  around my mind



Here I go, I'm  still  scratching  around  in the same old hole

My body  feels  young but my mind is very old

So what do you say?

You can't give me the  dreams  that are mine anyway

Half the  world  away, half the  world  away

Half the  world  away

I've been lost, I've been  found  but I don't feel down

(Oh I'm tired,  servicible  villain

Set you down father, rest you)There's no need for you to say you're  sorry  

Goodbye I'm  going  home 

I don't care no more so don't you  worry  

Goodbye I'm  going  home 



I hate the way that even  though  you 

Know you're  wrong  you say you're  right  

I hate the  books  you read and all your  friends  

Your music's  shitty  it  keeps  me up all  night  



There's no need for you to say you're  sorry  

Goodbye I'm  going  home 

I don't care no more so don't you  worry  

Goodbye I'm  going  home 



I hate the way that you are so  sarcastic  

And you're not very  bright  

You  think  that  everything  you've done's  fantastic  

Your music's  shitty  it  keeps  me up all  night  



And it will be nice to be  alone  

For a week or two 

But I know that I will be 

Right back here with you 



There's no need for you to say you're  sorry  

Goodbye I'm  going  home 

I don't care no more so don't you  worry  

Goodbye I'm  going  home 



I hate the way that even  though  you 

Know you're  wrong  you say you're  right  

I hate the  books  you read and all your  friends  

Your music's  shitty  it  keeps  me up all nightSlide away - and give it all you've got 

My  today  - fell in from the top 

I  dream  of you - and all the  things  you say 

I  wonder  where you are now? 

Hold me down - all the world's  asleep  

I need you now - you've  knocked  me off my feet 

I  dream  of you - and we talk of  growing  old 

But you said  please  don't! 



Slide in baby  together  we'll fly 

I've  tried  praying but I dont know what you're  saying  to me 



Now that you're mine 

We'll find a way 

Of  chasing  the sun 

Let me be the one who  shines  with you 

In the  morning  we don't know what to do 

Two of a kind 

We'll find a way 

To do what we've done 

Let me be the one who  shines  with you 

And we can  slide  away



Slide away 

Slide away

Away



Slide away - and give it all you've got 

My  today  - fell in from the top 

I  dream  of you - and all the  things  you say 

I  wonder  where you are now? 



Slide in baby  together  we'll fly 

I've  tried  praying and I know just what you're  saying  to me 



Now that you're mine 

We'll find a way 

Of  chasing  the sun 

Let me be the one who  shines  with you 

In the  morning  we don't know what to do 

Two of a kind 

We'll find a way 

To do what we've done 

Oh let me be the one who  shines  with you 

And we can  slide  away



Slide away (7x)

Oooh Ooh Oooh

Slide away (10x)

I need to be myself

I can't be no one else

I'm  feeling  supersonic

Give me gin and tonic

You can have it all but how much do you want it?

You make me laugh

Give me your autograph

Can I ride with you in your B.M.W?

You can sail with me in my  yellow  submarine



You need to find out

Cause no one's  gonna  tell you what I'm on about

You need to find a way for what you want to say

But  before  tomorrow



Cause my  friend  said he'd take you home

He sits in a  corner  all alone

He  lives  under a waterfall

Nobody can see him

Nobody  could  ever hear him call

Nobody  could  ever hear him call



You need to be yourself

You can't be no one else

I know a girl  called  Elsa

She's into Alka Seltzer

She  sniffs  it  through  a cane on a  supersonic  train

And she  makes  me laugh

I've got her autograph

She done it with a  doctor  on a helicopter

She's sniffin' in her tissue

Sellin' the big issue



When she  finds  out

No one's  gonna  tell her what I'm on about

You need to find a way for what you  wanna  say

But  before  tomorrow



Cause my  friend  said he'd take you home

He sits in a  corner  all alone

He  lives  under a waterfall

Nobody can see him

Nobody  could  ever hear him callA  little  space, a  little  time, see what it can do.
A  little  faith,  peace  of mind, see what  passes  through.
The sun will  shine  on you again, a bell will ring  inside  your head - and all will be  brand  new.

Come alive, come on in, here's  something  that you know.
The world's as wide, as your life is thin, So  entertain  your goals.
The sun will  shine  on you again, a bell will ring  inside  your head - and all will be  brand  new.

All will be  brand  new.

I can tell you what you want to hear, I've been  there  once before.
You  pulled  me  through  my  empty  nights,  sleepless  on your floor.
The sun will  shine  on you again, a bell will ring  inside  your head - and all will be  brand  new.

And all will be  brand  new.
And all will be  brand  new.I  could  be your lover, you  could  be all mine.

We'd go on for ever, 'til the end of time.

You  could  be my best friend, stay up all  night  long.

You  could  be my railroad, we'd go on and on.



Let's get along, there's  nothing  here to do.

Let's go find a rainbow.

I  could  be  wrong  - what am I to do?

Guess God  thinks  I'm Abel.



You  could  be my enemy, I  guess  there's  still  time.

I get  round  to  loving  you, is that such a crime?



Let's get along, there's  nothing  here to do.

Let's go find a rainbow.

I  could  be wrong, but what am I to do?

Guess God  thinks  I'm Abel.



No-one  could  break us.

No-one  could  take us.

If we tried.



No-one  could  break us.

No-one  could  take us.

If we tried.



No-one  could  break us.

No-one  could  take us.

If we tried.



Come on oh, let's make it tonight.I sold my soul for the  second  time, 'cause the man don't pay me.
I  begged  my  landlord  for some more time, he said "Son, the bill's waiting."
My best  friend  called me the  other  night, he said, "Man, are you crazy?"
My  girlfriend  told me to get a life, she said, "Boy, you lazy."

But I don't mind, as long as there's a bed  beneath  the  stars  that shine.
I'll be fine - if you give me a minute, a man's got a limit.
I can't get a life if my heart's not in it.


I don't mind, as long as there's a bed  beneath  the  stars  that shine.
I'll be fine - if you give me a minute, a man's got a limit.
I can't get a life if my heart's not in it.

I lost my  faith  in the summertime, 'cause it don't stop raining.
The sky all day is  black  as night, but I know I can't  blame  me.
I  begged  my  Doctor  for one more line, he said "Son,  words  fail me!"
There ain't no  place  to be  killing  time, I  guess  I'm just lazy.

I don't mind, as long as there's a bed  beneath  the  stars  that shine.
I'll be fine - if you give me a minute, a man's got a limit.
I can't get a life if my heart's not in it.Four Seasons, seconds, flicker, and flash, I'm alone

A  lonely  scream  provides  the scene, it's no hope

Every  night  I hear you scream, but you don't say what you mean

This was my dream, but now my  dream  has flown



I'm at the crossroads,  waiting  for a sign

My life is  standing  still, but I'm  still  alive

Every  night  I  think  I know,

In the  morning  where did it go?

The  answers  disappear when I open my eyes



I'm a  stranger  to this place,  where  real life and  dreams  collide

And even  though  I fall from grace, I will keep the  dream  alive

I will keep the  dream  alive



Four Seasons, seconds, flicker, and flash, I'm alone

A  lonely  scream  provides  the scene, it's no hope

Every  night  I hear you scream, but you don't say what you mean

This was my dream, but now my  dream  has flown



I'm a  stranger  to this place,  where  real life and  dreams  collide

And even  though  I fall from grace, I will keep the  dream  alive

I'm a  stranger  to this place,  where  real life and  dreams  collide

And even  though  I fall from grace, I will keep the  dream  aliveI see you, a woman, a  world  in my mind.

Girl I feel you, I'm  breathing  your love all the time.

'Cause you turn me on, your love's like a bomb,  blowing  my mind.

'Cause you turn me on, your love's like a bomb,  blowing  my mind.



Am I reaching, the  world  that I want deep inside.

Girl I mean it, you hold the key to the strife.

'Cause you turn me on, your love's like a bomb,  blowing  my mind.

'Cause you turn me on, your love's like a bomb,  blowing  my mind.



Blowing my mind.

Blowing my mind.

Blowing my mind.

Blowing my mind.



La la la la la la la.

Na na naaa na, na na na na na na naaah.



Na na na na, na na na na, na na na na.

Na na na na, na na na na, na na na na.





Yeah I'm seeing, a  whole  other  world  in my mind.

Girl I'm feeling, we've been in love all the time.

'Cause you turn me on, your love's like a bomb,  blowing  my mind.

'Cause you turn me on, your love's like a bomb,  blowing  my mind.



Yeah I'm seeing...Calling all the  stars  to fall
And  catch  the  silver  sunlight in your hands
Call for me to set me free
Lift me up and take me  where  I stand

She  believes  in everything
And  everyone  and you and  yours  and mine
I  waited  for a  thousand  years
For you to come and blow me off my mind

Hey Lyla
The  stars  about to fall
So what you say Lyla
The  world  around us  makes  me feel so
Small Lyla
If you can't hear me call
Then I can't say Lyla
Heaven help you  catch  me if I fall

She's the  queen  of all I've seen
And  every  song and city far and near
Heaven help my mademoiselle
She  rings  the bell for all the  world  to hear

Hey Lyla
The  stars  about to fall
So what you say Lyla
The  world  around us  makes  me feel so
Small Lyla
If you can't hear me call
Then I can't say Lyla
Heaven help you  catch  me if I fall

Hey Lyla
The  stars  about to fall
So what you say Lyla
The  world  around us  makes  me feel so
Small Lyla
If you can't hear me call
Then I can't say Lyla
Heaven help you  catch  me if I fall

Hey Lyla
Hey Lyla
Hey Lyla
Hey LylaI  gotta  show you 'bout the  meaning  of soul, I'm  taking  a love tonight.

Get  outta  my way, I did what you say, but that ain't  enough  alright.

I'm  different  bleach and an  Armarni  elite, I'm ten  outta  ten all night.

Get  outta  my way, I did what you say, but that ain't  enough  alright.



All rise, I see the love in your eyes.

If it's all right, then I'll be your light.



I  gotta  show you 'bout the  meaning  of soul, I'm  taking  a love tonight.

Get  outta  my way, I did what you say, but that ain't  enough  alright.

I'm  different  bleach and an  Armarni  elite, I'm ten  outta  ten all night.

Get  outta  my way, I did what you say, but that ain't  enough  alright.



All rise, I see the love in your eyes.

If it's all right, then I'll be your light.



I  gotta  show you 'bout the  meaning  of soul, I'm  taking  a love tonight.I know you  think  you  deserve  an  explanation  on the  meanings  of life.

But what you  think  that you  heard  slipped away out the back of your mind.

You'll get your  mucky  fingers burned.

You get your  truth  from the lies you were learned.

And all your  plastic  believers will  leave  us and they won't return.



And when you look in that  mirror  

And you're  tying  up your  buttons  and bows.

And as you face your  disease  you can  squeeze  into the Emporer's Clothes.

You  found  your god in a  paper  bag, you get your  history  from the  Union  Jack.

And all your  brothers  and  sisters  are gone and they won't come back.



I'm fed up with life in the City,

All the  phoneys  have  blown  my mind.

When I'm gone, you look like you'd miss me,

So come  along  with me - but don't ask why,

'Cause it's all mine,

It's all mine.

It's all mine.

It's all mine.



[Harmonica Solo]



'Cause it's all mine

It's all mine

It's all mine

It's all mine



[Harmonica Solo 2]So then be off, find that I've lost my way in the city.

The  streets  and the  thousands  of  colours  all  bleed  into one.

I fall down,  Heaven  won't help me.

I call out, no-one  would  hear.

All of a  sudden  I've lost my way out of the City.



Stand tall,  stand  proud.

Every  beginning  is  breaking  it's promise. 

I'm  having  trouble just  finding  some soul in this town.



Name on the  faces  in  places  - they mean  nothing  to me.

It's all they can do to be part of a  queue  in this town.

I fall down,  Heaven  won't help me.

I call out, no-one will hear.

"There'll be no tomorrow" they say, well I'll say "more's the pity."



Stand tall,  stand  proud.

Every  beginning  has  broken  it's promise. 

I'm  having  trouble just  finding  some soul in this town.



Stand tall,  stand  proud.

Every  beginning  has  broken  it's promise. 

I'm  having  trouble just  finding  my soul in this town.



Finding my soul in this town.

Keep on trying...

Keep on trying...

Keep on trying...

Keep on trying...

Keep on trying...

Keep on trying...

Keep on trying...

Keep on trying...



Na na na na na na na na....I  carry  a Madness,

Over the border.

I get  round  to  loving  you

Is that such a crime.



Lets get along

There's  nothing  here to do

Lets go find a Rainbow.



I  could  be wrong

But what am I to do

I  guess  god  thinks  I'm Abel.

Only pain and sorrow

I  promise  I won't bite

Let's go see the sun burst

Wait til I go numb first



And in the  morning  come to us

And if the  evening  showers us

'cause what will be will be

I can hear the thunder

Gonna stop the hunger



And in the  morning  come to us

And if the  evening  showers us

Sing to us



To all my  sisters  yeah you're  looking  pretty fine

And to all my  brothers  I bet you're  feeling  kinda high

And to all the  mothers  well come on now, don't be shy

And to all the  fathers  who are sick and  fucking  tiredI  would  like to  leave  this city

This old town don't  smell  too  pretty  and

I can feel the  warning  signs  running  around my mind

And when I  leave  this  island  I'll book  myself  into a soul asylum

'Cause I can feel the  warning  signs  running  around my mind



So here I go, I'm  still  scratching  around  in the same old hole

My body  feels  young but my mind is very old

So what do you say?

You can't give me the  dreams  that are mine anyway

Half the  world  away, half the  world  away

Half the  world  away

I've been lost, I've been  found  but I don't feel down



And when I  leave  this planet

You know I'd stay but I just can't  stand  it and

I can feel the  warning  signs  running  around my mind

And if I  could  leave this spirit

I'll find me a hole and I will live in it and

I can feel the  warning  signs  running  around my mind



Here I go, I'm  still  scratching  around  in the same old hole

My body  feels  young but my mind is very old

So what do you say?

You can't give me the  dreams  that are mine anyway

Half the  world  away, half the  world  away

Half the  world  away

I've been lost, I've been  found  but I don't feel down



No, I don't feel down

No, I don't feel down



I don't feel down

I don't feel down

Don't feel down

I don't feel downPaint no illusion, try to  click  with  whatcha  got

Taste  every  potion 'cause if yer like  yerself  a lot

Go let it out, go let it in, go let it out 



Life is  precocious  in a most  peculiar  way

Sister  psychosis  don't got a lot to say

She go let it out, she go let it in, she go let it out

She go let it out, she go let it in, she go let it out 



Is it any  wonder  why  Princes  & Kings

Are  clowns  that  caper  in  their  sawdust rings

Ordinary  people  that are like you and me

We're the  keepers  of  their  destiny,

We're the  keepers  of  their  destiny 



I'm goin'  leaving  this city, I'm goin' drivin'  outta  town

And your comin' with me the  right  time is  always  now

To go let it out, to go let it in, and go let it out

To go let it out, to go let it in, and go let it out 



Is it any  wonder  why  Princes  and Kings

Are  clowns  that  caper  in  their  sawdust rings

Ordinary  people  that are like you and me

We're the  builders  of  their  destiny

We're the  builders  of  their  destiny

We're the  builders  of  their  destiny

We're the  builders  of  their  destiny 



So go let it out, go let it in

Go let it out, don't let it in

Go let it out, go let it in

Go let it out, don't let it, don't let it in, don't let it inWho  kicked  a hole in the sky

So the  heavens  would cry over me?

Who  stole  the soul from the sun

In a  world  come  undone  at the seams?



Let  there  be love

Let  there  be love...



I hope the  weather  is calm

As you sail up your  heavenly  stream

Suspended  clear  in the sky

Are the  words  that we sing in our dreams



Let  there  be love

Let  there  be love... [Repeat: x 2]



(Noel)



Come on baby blue

Shake up your  tired  eyes

The  world  is  waiting  for you

May all your dreaming

Fill the  empty  sky



But if it  makes  you happy

Keep on clapping

Just  remember  I'll be by your side

And if you don't let go

It's  gonna  pass you by...



Who  kicked  a hole in the sky

So the  heavens  would cry over me?

Who  stole  the soul from the sun

In a  world  come  undone  at the seams?



Let  there  be love

Let  there  be love... [Repeat: x 4]



Let  there  be loveI?m  tired  and I?m sick

Got a  habit  that I just can?t kick

(I) Feel  hungover  and I?m all in love

When the  lights  go down

I?m  gonna  shoot ?em all/up


S?alrite

Don?t be afraid

You  gotta  keep  dreaming  in the bed you made

And if it  tastes  like shit

Well, it  beats  sleeping  rough  on the floor


Keep  saying  that my head?s  locked  up in the clouds

Keep  praying  that the lord won?t slow me down

I?m  tired  and I?m sick

Got a  habit  that I can?t, won?t lick

Feel  hungover  and I?m all in love

Let the  lights  go down

Me and you are  gonna  shoot em all/up


Keep  saying  that my head?s  locked  up in the clouds

Keep  praying  that the lord won?t slow me down

I?m  tired  and I?m sick

Got a  habit  that I just can?t kick

Feel  hungover  and I?m all in love

When the  lights  go down

Me and you are  gonna  shoot em all/up
Get off your high  horse  lady, I don't need a ride tonight

Get off your high  horse  lady, I don't need a ride tonight

Lay down



I hear your soul song  singing  from a fire in the sky

I hear your soul song  singing  from a fire in the sky

Rain down

Rain down



Get off your high  horse  lady, I don't need a ride tonight

Get off your high  horse  lady, I don't need a ride tonight

Lay down

Lay downThey got  nothing  on me anymore, 

They got  nothing  on you

I don't care what they say anymore, 

All I want is the truth



I don't feel

To unveil,

Here's a song,

Sing along



They got  nothing  from me anymore, 

I got  nothing  from you

I don't care what they say anymore, 

All I want is the truth



I don't feel

To unveil,

Here's a song,

Sing along

Watch my style,

Pick a place,

Wipe the smile

From your face



I don't feel

To unveil,

Here's a song,

Sing along

Watch my style,

Pick a place,

Wipe the smile

From your face



They got  nothing  on me anymore,

They got  nothing  on you

I don't care what they say anymore, 

All I want is the truthGold and  silver  and  sunshine  is  rising  up

Pour  yourself  another cup of Lady Grey

Take my hand in the meantime, when you've had enough

You'll find me on the end of a runway, babe



Tell the  world  that you love them in a melody

Send my old  piano  and a telegram

Gotta get me a  doctor  with a remedy

I'm  gonna  take a walk with the  Monkey  Man!



Someone tell me I'm dreaming

The  freaks  are  rising  up  through  the floor

Everything I  believe  in

Is  telling  me that I want more, more, more



[Chorus]

Lay your love on the fire when you come on in

I got my hee-bee-jee-bees in a  hidden  bag

Tell me what you  desire  and we'll bag it up, high



Someone tell me I'm dreaming

The  freaks  are  rising  up  through  the floor

Everything I  believe  in

Is  telling  me that I want more, more, more



[Chorus]



Shine a  light  on your fire when you come on in

I got my hee-bee-jee-bees in a  hidden  bag

Tell me what you  desire  and we'll bag it up, highThe  summer  sun

It  blows  my mind

It's  falling  down on all that I've ever known

Time to kiss the  world  goodbye

Falling down on all that I've ever known

Is all that I've ever known



A  dying  scream

It  makes  no sound

Calling out to all that I've ever known

Here am I, lost and found

Calling out to all



We live a  dying  dream

If you know what I mean

All that I've ever known

It's all that I've ever known



Catch the  wheel  that  breaks  the butterfly

I  cried  the rain that  fills  the  ocean  wide

I  tried  to talk with God to no avail

Calling my name and out of nowhere

I said "If you won't save me,  please  don't  waste  my time"



(All that I've ever known)

(It's all that I've ever known)



Catch the  wheel  that  breaks  the butterfly

I  cried  the rain that  fills  the  ocean  wide

I  tried  to talk with God to no avail

Calling my name and out of nowhere

I said "If you won't save me,  please  don't  waste  my time"



The  summer  sun

It  blows  my mind

It's  falling  down on all that I've ever known

Time to kiss the  world  goodbye

Falling down on all that I've ever known

Is all that I've ever knownHere is a song

It  reminds  me of when we were young

Looking back at all the  things  we've done

You  gotta  keep on, keepin' on



Out to sea, it's the only  place  I honestly

Can't get  myself  some  piece  of mind

You know it's  getting  hard to fly



If I'm to fall

Would you be  there  to applaud?

Or  would  you hide  behind  them all?

'Cause if I have to go,

In my  heart  you grow

And that's  where  you belong



If I'm to fall

Would you be  there  to applaud?

Or  would  you hide  behind  them all?

'Cause if I have to go,

In my  heart  you'll grow

And that's  where  you belong



If I'm to fall

Would you be  there  to applaud?

Or  would  you hide  behind  them all?

'Cause if I have to go

In my  heart  you'll grow

And that's  where  you belong



Guess I'm  outta  time

I'm  outta  time

I'm  outta  time

I'm  outta  time

I'm  outta  timeThe  nature  of reality

Is pure  subjective  fantasy

Space and time and here and now

Are only in your mind



Machine of god and  devil  too

With no  weapons  just the truth

Belief does not  existence  make

It's only in your mind



The  nature  of reality

Is only in your mindI'm all over my heart's desire,

I feel cold but I'm back in the fire,

Out of  control  but I'm tied up tight,

Come in, come out tonight



Coming up in the  early  morning,

I feel love in the  shock  of the lightning,

I fall into the  blinding  light,

Come in, come out, come in, come out tonight



[Chorus]

Love is a time machine,

Up on the  silver  screen,

It's all in my mind,

Love is a litany,

A  magical  mystery,

And all in good time, 

And all in good time,

And all in good time



I got my feet on the  street  but I can't stop flying,

My head's in the  clouds  but at  least  I'm trying,

I'm out of  control  but I'm tied up tight,

Come in, come out tonight



There's a hole in the  ground  into  which  I'm falling,

So God's  speed  to the  sound  of the pounding,

I'm all into the  blinding  light,

Come in, come out, come in, come out tonight



[Chorus]



It's all in my mind,

Love is a time machine,

Up on the  silver  screen,

And all in good time, 

And all in good time,

And all in good timeHold a light,

Friend of mine,

Sing a song,

Soldier on.



Shine a light,

For me tonight,

Don't be long,

Soldier on.



Whose to say,

That you were right,

And I was wrong,

Soldier on.



Come the day,

Come the night,

I'll be gone,

Soldier on.



Soldier on

Soldier on

Soldier onDay's  turning  to night

Pray for the light

Let me come through

Let me take you away over the line



Everyone falling

Everyone falling

Dreamers come crawling

Neighbors jump walling

Let me come through

Let me take you away over the line



And we're away to be  where  there's life

Shake the will to comply

Fears don't try me

Tears don't cry me



And we're away to be  where  there's life

When we come call out

Everything's sold out

TV just  closed  down

There's  nothing  on the news now



Fears don't try me

Tears don't cry me

We're away to be  where  there's life

Be  where  there's life

(Be  where  there's life)



Dig out your soul, cos here we go

We  gotta  move, it's what we do

Let me come through

Let me take you 

Away to be  where  there's life

To be  where  there's life

(To be  where  there's life)



Take you over the light

Under the signs

In  through  locked  doors  

To  secret  floors

Where we've lost 'em beforeEyes over the city

Rise up from your soul

They hang over the  streets  at night

Brought on by the cold



We live with the numbers

Mining our  dreams  for the same old song

Why hope for the turning

If  everything  you know is wrong



[Chorus]

So come on,  shake  your rag doll, baby

Before you  change  your mind

Then come on, when the  rapture  takes me

Be the  fallen  angel by my side



You  carry  the lantern

I'll  carry  you home

You  search  for the disappeared

I'll bury the cold



Yours is a messiah

Mine is a  dream  and it won't be long

No hope for the journey

If no-one ever sees the dawn



So come on,  shake  your rag doll, baby

Before you  change  your mind

Then come on, when the  rapture  takes me

Will you be by my side



[Chorus]



So come on,  shake  your rag doll, baby

Before you  change  your mind

Then come on, when the  rapture  takes me

Will you be by my side



Hey come on,  shake  your rag doll, baby

Before you  change  your mind

And come on, when the  rapture  takes me

Be the  fallen  angel by my side



(Shake your rag doll baby)

(Shake it 'round)

(Shake your rag doll baby)

(Shake it 'round)I  still  don't know what I was  waiting  for

A big love to fall down from the sky

She took my hand and  picked  me up off the floor

She put an  apple  in my eye



[Chorus]

I said I'm tired

Come get me off the merry-go-round

I'm wired

Come feed me and then bring-a-me down



She come up to me

I can't  remember  what she said

'Cause I was in a  trance  and I  forgot  it all

Banging on  about  all that

Revolution in her head

She'd make a  lover  seem so magical



She said I'm tired

Come get me off the merry-go-round

I'm wired

Well  heaven  must have sent ya

To save me from the rapture



[Chorus]You sing, you shout, you turn the  world  around

Yeah, we come out  together  for you



You let me see the man I'm  gonna  be

Yeah, we come out  together  for you



Remember to shine

Let my love take you high

You've nothin' to lose

You're just a boy with the blues



You take a vow  never  to back down

Yeah, we come out  together  for you



And my  dreams  are  bound  to come true somehow

Yeah, we come out  together  for you



Remember to shine

Let my love take you high

You've nothin' to lose

You're just a boy with the blues

Remember to smile

Let my love take you high

I'm nothin' to lose

I'm just a boy with the blues

Yeah



Come out together, come out together

Come out  together  for you



Come out together, come out together

Come out  together  for you



Come out together, come out together

Come out  together  for you



Come out together, come out together

Come out  together  for you



Come out together, come out together

Come out  together  for you



Come out together, come out together

Come out  together  for you



Come out together, come out together

Come out  together  for youGet off your high  horse  Lady, I don't need a ride tonight

Get off your high  horse  lady, I don't need a ride tonight

Lay down



I hear your soul song  singing  from a fire in the sky

I hear your soul song  singing  from a fire in the sky

Rain down

Get off your high  horse  lady, I don't need a ride tonight

Get off your high  horse  lady, I don't need a ride tonight

Be the  fallen  angel by my sideI can't see the wood for the trees

Life is like a  roller  coaster

I can't find the  birds  or the bees

Hope they're down the back of my sofa



Feeling like a  rolling  stone

Playing the  guitar  on my own

I'm the  apple  of my eye

If only I  could  keep  myself  sober i'd  remind  myself why



They  stare  at me  wherever  I go

Why won't  everybody  give up, no

I wish I  learn  to play piano



If only I  could  get my self  sober  for more then one dayWhen I was young

I  thought  I had my own key

I knew  exactly  

What I  wanted  to be

Now I'm sure

You've  boarded  up  every  door



Lived in a bubble

Days were  never  ending

Was not  concerned  

About what life was sending

Fantasy was real

Now I know much  about  the way I feel



I'll  paint  you the picture

'Cause I don't think

You live  round  here no more

I've  never  even seen

The key to the door

We only get what we will  settle  for



While we're living

The  dreams  we have as  children  fade away

While we're living

The  dreams  we have as  children  fade away

While we're living

The  dreams  we have as  children  fade away

While we're living

The  dreams  we have as  children  fade away away away

They fade away away away



Now my life has turned

Another corner

I  think  it's only best

That I  should  warn you

Dream it  while  you can

Maybe  someday  I'll make you understand



I'll  paint  you the picture

'Cause I don't think

You live  round  here no more

I've  never  even seen

The key to the door

We only get what we will  settle  for



While we're living

The  dreams  we have as  children  fade away

While we're living

The  dreams  we have as  children  fade away

While we're living

The  dreams  we have as  children  fade away

While we're living

The  dreams  we have as  children  fade away away away

They fade away away away

They fade away away away

Fade away away awayStep off the  train  all  alone  at dawn

Back into the hole  where  I was born

The sun in the sky  never  raised an eye to me

The  blood  on the tracks, and they must be mine

The fool on the hill, and I feel fine

Don't look back 'cause you know what you  might  see



Look into the wall of my mind's eye

I  think  I know, but I don't know why

The  questions  are the  answers  you  might  need

Coming in a mess,  going  out in style

I ain't good-looking, but I'm someone's child

No one can give me the air that's mine to breathe



I met my maker

I made him cry

And on my  shoulder  he  asked  me why

His  people  won't fly  through  the storm

I said  listen  up man, they don't even know you're born



All my  people  right here,  right  now

D'you know what I mean? Yeah, yeah

All my  people  right here,  right  now

D'you know what I mean? Yeah, yeah

All my  people  right here,  right  now

D'you know what I mean? Yeah, yeah

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah



I don't  really  care for what you believe

So open up your fist or you won't receive

The  thoughts  and the  words  of  every  man you'll need

Get up off the  floor  and  believe  in life

No one's ever  gonna  ever ask you twice

Get on the bus and  bring  it on home to me



I met my maker

I made him cry

And on my  shoulder  he  asked  me why

His  people  won't fly  through  the storm

I said "Listen up man, they don't even know you're born"



All my  people  right here,  right  now

They know what I mean yeah, yeah

All my  people  right here,  right  now

They know what I mean yeah, yeah

All my  people  right here,  right  now

They know what I mean yeah, yeah

Yeah, yeah

Yeah, yeah

Yeah, yeah



All my  people  right here,  right  now

D'you know what I mean? Yeah, yeah

All my  people  right here,  right  now

D'you know what I mean? Yeah, yeah

All my  people  right here,  right  now

D'you know what I mean? Yeah, yeah

Yeah, yeah

Yeah, yeah

Yeah, yeah

Yeah, yeahSlip  inside  the eye of your mind

Don't you know you  might  find

A  better  place to play

You said that you'd  never  been

But all the  things  that you've seen

Will  slowly  fade away



So I  start  a  revolution  from my bed

'Cause you said the  brains  I had went to my head.

Step outside, summertime's in bloom

Stand up  beside  the fireplace

Take that look from off your face

You ain't ever  gonna  burn my  heart  out



And so  Sally  can wait, she  knows  it's too late as we're  walking  on by

Her soul  slides  away, but don't look back in  anger  I  heard  you say



Take me to the  place  where you go

Where  nobody  knows if it's  night  or day

But  please  don't put your life in the hands

Of a Rock n Roll band

Who'll  throw  it all away



I'm  gonna  start a  revolution  from my bed

'Cause you said the  brains  I had went to my head

Step  outside  'cause summertime's in bloom

Stand up  beside  the fireplace

Take that look from off your face

'Cause you ain't ever  gonna  burn my  heart  out



So  Sally  can wait, she  knows  it's too late as she's  walking  on by

My soul  slides  away, but don't look back in  anger  I  heard  you say



So  Sally  can wait, she  knows  it's too late as we're  walking  on by

Her soul  slides  away, but don't look back in  anger  I  heard  you say



So  Sally  can wait

She  knows  it's too late as she's  walking  on by

My soul  slides  away

But don't look back in anger

Don't look back in anger

I  heard  you say



At  least  not todayOne, two, three, four



Who  kicked  a hole in the sky so the  heavens  would cry over me?

Who  stole  the soul from the sun in a  world  come  undone  at the seams?

Let  there  be love 

Let  there  be love



I hope the  weather  is calm as you sail up your  heavenly  stream

Suspended  clear  in the sky are the  words  that we sing in our dreams

Let  there  be love 

Let  there  be love 

Let  there  be love 

Let  there  be love



Come on baby blue

Shake up your  tired  eyes

The  world  is  waiting  for you

May all your  dreaming  fill the  empty  sky



But if it  makes  you happy

Keep on clapping

Just  remember  I'll be by your side

And if you don't let go, it's  gonna  pass you by



Who  kicked  a hole in the sky so the  heavens  would cry over me?

Who  stole  the soul from the sun in a  world  come  undone  at the seams?

Let  there  be love 

Let  there  be love



Let  there  be love 

Let  there  be love 

Let  there  be love 

Let  there  be love

Let  there  be love 

Let  there  be love 

Let  there  be loveToday is  gonna  be the day

That they're  gonna  throw it back to you

By now you should've somehow

Realized what you  gotta  do

I don't  believe  that anybody

Feels the way I do,  about  you now



Back beat, the word was on the street

That the fire in your  heart  is out

I'm sure you've  heard  it all before

But you  never  really had a doubt

I don't  believe  that anybody

Feels the way I do  about  you now



And all the  roads  we have to walk are winding

And all the  lights  that lead us  there  are blinding

There are many  things  that I

Would like to say to you but I don't know how



Because maybe, you're  gonna  be the one that  saves  me

And  after  all, you're my wonderwall



Today was  gonna  be the day

But they'll  never  throw it back to you

By now you should've somehow

Realized what you're not to do

I don't  believe  that anybody

Feels the way I do,  about  you now



And all the  roads  that lead you  there  are winding

And all the  lights  that  light  the way are blinding

There are many  things  that I

Would like to say to you but I don't know how



I said maybe, you're  gonna  be the one that  saves  me

And  after  all, you're my wonderwall



I said maybe, you're  gonna  be the one that  saves  me

And  after  all, you're my wonderwall



I said maybe, you're  gonna  be the one that  saves  me

You're  gonna  be the one that  saves  me

You're  gonna  be the one that  saves  meTalking to the  songbird  yesterday 

Flew me to a past not far away 

She's a  little  pirate in my mind 

Singing  songs  of love to pass the time 



Gonna  write  a song so she can see 

Give her all the love she  gives  to me 

Talk of  better  days that have yet to come 

Never felt this love from  anyone  



She's not anyone

She's not  anyone  

She's not  anyone  



A man can  never  dream  these  kind of  things  

Especially when she came and  spread  her  wings  

Whispered in my ear the  things  I'd like

Then she flew away into the  night  



Gonna  write  a song so she can see 

Give her all the love she  gives  to me 

Talk of  better  days that have yet to come 

Never felt this love from  anyone  



She's not anyone

She's not  anyone  

She's not anyoneYou  gotta  roll with it

You  gotta  take your time

You  gotta  say what you say

Don't let  anybody  get in your way

'Cause it's all too much for me to take



Don't ever  stand  aside

Don't ever be denied

You  wanna  be who you'd be

If you're  coming  with me



I  think  I've got a  feeling  I've lost inside

I  think  I'm  gonna  take me away and hide

I'm  thinking  of  things  that I just can't abide



I know the  roads  down  which  your life will drive

I find the key that lets you slip inside

Kiss the girl, she's not  behind  the door

But you know I  think  I  recognize  your face

But I've  never  seen you before



You  gotta  roll with it

You  gotta  take your time

You  gotta  say what you say

Don't let any  fucker  get in your way

'Cause it's all too much for me to take



I know the  roads  down  which  your life will drive

I find the key that lets you slip inside

Kiss the girl, she's not  behind  the door

But you know I  think  I  recognize  your face

But I've  never  seen you before



You  gotta  roll with it

You  gotta  take your time

You  gotta  say what you say

Don't let  anybody  get in your way

'Cause it's all too much for me to take



Don't ever  stand  aside

Don't ever be denied

You  wanna  be who you'd be

If you're  coming  with me



I  think  I've got a  feeling  I've lost inside
