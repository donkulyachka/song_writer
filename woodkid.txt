Buying some vintage records in Williamsberg stores
Playing paper boats on east river shores
Meeting mermaids and lobsters in Coney Island
Puking our deep fried Oreos in Astroland
Spending our days watching skylines from rooftops
On Independence Day, Manhattan fireworks
Life is easier where the walls are red
Brooklyn is a place stuck in my head
Here in Paris the rain is falling
My heart belongs to Brooklyn

I'm sick of four star food, I want to be where life is
As simple as two bucks pizza slices
I swear I'll tell you, next time I knock at your door
That I am not leaving Brooklyn anymore
Would it be that nice if you were not part of it?
Would Brooklyn be worth crossing the Atlantic
Life is easier where we can join our hands
Your face is a face that's stuck in my head
Here in Paris rain is falling
My heart belongs to Brooklyn

Life is easier where we can join our hands
Your face is a face that's stuck in my head
Here in Paris rain is falling
My heart belongs to BrooklynMost of my sweet memories were buried in the sand

The fire and the pain will now be coming to an end

How did you get to save me from this desolate wasteland

In your eyes I see the dawn of brighter days again.



With my tears you washed away the mud stuck on my hands

All the things you're trying to do make me a better man

Now I remember the joy and the taste of candy cane

The innocence of youth and the sound of major scales.



Most of what I used to be had vanished in the waves

The memories of the boy I've been were drowning and you saved them

Now I remember the joy and the meaning of the fate

The color of the truth and the sound of sunny days.



Most of my sweet memories were buried in the sand

The fire and the pain will now be coming to an end

How did you get to save me from this desolate wasteland

In your eyes I see the dawn of brighter days again.Run boy run! This world is not made for you

Through the tides of oceans

We are shining in the rising sun



As we are floating in the blue

I am softly watching you

Oh boy your eyes betray what burns inside you



Whatever I feel for you

You only seem to care about you

Is there any chance you could see me too?

'Cause I love you

Is there anything I could do

Just to get some attention from you?

In the waves I've lost every trace of you

Where are you?



After all I drifted ashore

Through the streams of oceans

Whispers wasted in the sand



As we were dancing in the blue

I was synchronized with you

But now the sound of love is out of tune



Whatever I feel for you

You only seem to care about you

Is there any chance you could see me too?

'Cause I love you

Is there anything I could do

Just to get some attention from you?

In the waves I've lost every trace of you

Where are you?



Whatever I feel for you

You only seem to care about you

Is there any chance you could see me too?

'Cause I love you

Is there anything I could do

Just to get some attention from you?

In the waves I've lost every trace of you

Where are you?Walking through fields of gold

In the distance, bombs can fall

Boy we're running free

Facing light in the flow

And in the cherry trees

We're hiding from the world

But the golden age is over

But the golden age is over



Boy, we're dancing through the snow

Waters freeze, the wind blows

Did you ever feel

We're falling as we grow

No I would not believe

The light could ever go

But the golden age is over

But the golden age is over



Listen, I can hear the call

As I'm walking through the door



Did you ever dream we'd miss

The mornings in the sun

The playgrounds in the streets

The bliss of slumber land

Boy, we're family

No matter what they say

But boys are made to flee

And run away one day



When the golden age is over

Oh the golden age is over

But the golden age is over

The golden age is overTell me that we'll always be together

We'll be riding horses all the way

'Cause boy I feel that men are meant to be

More than the shadows of each other



This road is finally standing up to the sky

Boy we're free, so what is fate to say

How things are gonna turn out now?



If storms are breaking over great escapes

Boy, we'll find how to make it with the rain

This rage will lead us through the burning plains

No matter what they say, we're heroes, boy we'll get to break out



Now we're finally standing up to the sky

Look at me, boy, so what is fate to say

How things are gonna turn out now?

Can't you see that we're dead until we wake up

All your dreams are about to happen now

We are racing to the break of dawnWhere the light shivers offshore

Through the tides of oceans

We are shining in the rising sun



As we are floating in the blue

I am softly watching you

Oh boy your eyes betray what burns inside you



Whatever I feel for you

You only seem to care about you

Is there any chance you could see me too?

'Cause I love you

Is there anything I could do

Just to get some attention from you?

In the waves I've lost every trace of you

Where are you?



After all I drifted ashore

Through the streams of oceans

Whispers wasted in the sand



As we were dancing in the blue

I was synchronized with you

But now the sound of love is out of tune



Whatever I feel for you

You only seem to care about you

Is there any chance you could see me too?

'Cause I love you

Is there anything I could do

Just to get some attention from you

In the waves I've lost every trace of you

Where are you?



Whatever I feel for you

'Cause I love you

Is there anything I could do

Just to get some attention from you

In the waves I've lost every trace of you

Oh where are you?In the glorious days, till we lost our ways
Hey, do you recall when the war was just a game?
Now the wind ventures to other plains
Hey, when will I see you again if I go?

This train whistles and blows all sounds away
Hey, how could we be close again?

Now the night is bathing in disgrace
Hey, do you still braid some flowers in your hair
Come the sound of boots and metal chains
Hey, will the perfume of the daisies remain?

A circus of horses in dancing in the bay
Hey, now the fire's in the way
The past is sucked by quicksands I'm afraid
Hey, do you recall when the war was just a game?Popping pills this Molly heat

And they're rising on their feet

Take some xans to come down

Now I'm feeling dead

Popping pills this Molly heat

And they're rising on their feet

Take some xans to come down

Now I'm feeling dead



Short change that gram

It girls and socialites, white powder in their hands

Getting twisted, they hella lifted, they asking 'bout them xans

Trouble making these baby faces, I'm blunted with some man

Asking me about poetry and I wanna leave but I can't

Body high like a thousand miles up in the sky, goddamn

He using words I never heard, I'm looking at my friend

He macking deep and he tryna creep on that black girl wearing Vans

They blasting Nelly and Missy Elliott like high school never ends

Like high school never ends

Like high school never ends

Like high school never ends



Popping pills this Molly heat

And they're rising on their feet

Take some xans to come down

Now I'm feeling dead

Popping pills this Molly heat

And they're rising on their feet

Take some xans to come down

Now I'm feeling dead



Up on this roof

Breaking diesel, I'm feeling evil, rich kids got the best views

The whole city looks so pretty, I'm sorry 'bout being rude

Everybody got wet hair cause they just came from the pool

They kissing but I'm missing out, yo homie, it's cool

Getting texts I don’t wanna get and I’m writing back like fuck you

Buzz killa, yo nothing's realer, I'm so fucking confused

You say that you want love but then go fuck other dudes

Treating me like you don't need me, I guess a nigga old news

So hazy, real slim shady, I can't find my shoes

I can't find my shoes

I can't find my shoes, shit



Why don't you just delete me?

Why don't you just delete me?

Why don't you just delete me?

Why don't you just delete me?



You know what my, you know what my love's about (ey)

Fucking with my head, let my heart bleed out (ey)
