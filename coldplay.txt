In the  darkness  before the dawn
In the  swirling  of this storm
When I'm  rolling  with the  punches  and hope is gone
Leave a light, a  light  on

Millions of  miles  from home
In the  swirling  swimming on
When I'm  rolling  with the  thunder  but  bleed  from thorns
Leave a light, a  light  on
Leave a light, a  light  on

Leave a light, a  light  on
Leave a light, a  light  on

In the  darkness  before the dawn
In the  darkness  before the dawn
Leave a light, a  light  on
Leave a light, a  light  on
Come up to meet you 
Tell you I'm sorry
You don't know how  lovely  you are
I had to find you
Tell you I need you
Tell you I set you apart

Tell me your secrets
And ask me your questions
Oh let's go back to the start
Running in circles;  coming  up tails
Heads on a  silence  apart 

Nobody said it was easy
It's such a  shame  for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it  would  be this hard
Oh take me back to the start

I was just  guessing  at  numbers  and figures
Pulling your  puzzles  apart
Questions of science;  science  and progress
Do not  speak  as loud as my heart

Tell me you love me
Come back and  haunt  me
Oh and I rush to the start
Running in circles,  chasing  our tails
Coming back as we are

Nobody said it was easy
Oh it's such a  shame  for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it  would  be so hard
I'm  going  back to the start

Oh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Oh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Oh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Oh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Well, they say  people  come
The say  people  go
This  particular  diamond was  extra  special
And  though  you  might  be gone, and the  world  may not know
Still I see you, celestial

And I  should  but I can't let you go
But when I'm cold, I'm cold
Yeah, when I'm cold
Cold
There’s a  light  that you give me when I’m in shadow
There’s a  feeling  within me, an everglow

Like  brothers  in blood, or  sisters  who ride
Yeah we  swore  on that  night  we’d be  friends  'til we die
But the  changing  of winds, and the way  waters  flow
Life is  short  as the  falling  of snow
And I’m  gonna  miss you, I know

But when I’m cold, cold
In  water  rolled, salt
And I know that you’re with me and the way you will show
And you’re with me  wherever  I go
And you give me this feeling, this everglow

What I wouldn't give for just a  moment  to hold
Because, I live for this feeling, this everglow

So if you love someone, you  should  let them know
Oh, the  light  that you left me will everglow
Well, they say  people  come
The say  people  go
This  particular  diamond was  extra  special
And  though  you  might  be gone, and the  world  may not know
Still I see you, celestial

And I  should  but I can't let you go
But when I'm cold, I'm cold
Yeah, when I'm cold
Cold
There’s a  light  that you give me when I’m in shadow
There’s a  feeling  within me, an everglow

Like  brothers  in blood, or  sisters  who ride
Yeah we  swore  on that  night  we’d be  friends  'til we die
But the  changing  of winds, and the way  waters  flow
Life is  short  as the  falling  of snow
And I’m  gonna  miss you, I know

But when I’m cold, cold
In  water  rolled, salt
And I know that you’re with me and the way you will show
And you’re with me  wherever  I go
And you give me this feeling, this everglow

What I wouldn't give for just a  moment  to hold
Because, I live for this feeling, this everglow

So if you love someone, you  should  let them know
Oh, the  light  that you left me will everglow

God is  watching  me
God is, God don't  praise  me  because  I be Joe Fraiser
God don't give nothin' 'bout Joe Fraiser
God don't care nothin'  about  England or  America  as far as
Your  wealth  is all his
He  wants  to know how do we  treat  each other, how do we help each other
So, I'm  gonna  dedicate my life to  using  my name and  popularity  to  helping  charities
Helping people,  unite  with  people  bring  people  bombing each  other  because of  religious  beliefs
We need  somebody  in the  world  to help us all make peace
So when I die, if there's a  heaven  I'm  gonna  see it
Just  because  I'm losing
Doesn't mean I'm lost
Doesn't mean I'll stop
Doesn't mean I will cross

Just  because  I'm hurting
Doesn't mean I'm hurt
Doesn't mean I didn't get what I deserve
No  better  and no worse

I just got lost
Every  river  that I've  tried  to cross
And  every  door I ever  tried  was locked
Oh, and I'm just  waiting  'till the  shine  wears off.

You  might  be a big fish
In a  little  pond
Doesn't mean you've won
'Cause  along  may come
A  bigger  one
And you'll be lost

Every  river  that you  tried  to cross
Every gun you ever held went off
Oh, and I'm just  waiting  'till the  firing  starts
Oh, and I'm just  waiting  'till the  shine  wears off
Oh, and I'm just  waiting  'till the  shine  wears off

Oh, and I'm just  waiting  'till the  shine  wears off
Oh, and I'm just  waiting  'till the  shine  wears off.
Christmas night,  another  fight
Tears we  cried  a flood
Got all  kinds  of  poison  in
Of  poison  in my blood

I took my feet
To  Oxford  Street
Trying to  right  a wrong
Just walk away
Those  windows  say
But I can't  believe  she's gone

When you're  still  waiting for the snow to fall
Doesn't  really  feel like  Christmas  at all

Up  above  candles on air flicker
Oh they  flicker  and they float
But I'm up here  holding  on
To all  those  chandeliers of hope

Like some  drunken  Elvis singing
I go  singing  out of tune
Saying how I  always  loved you darling
And I  always  will

Oh when you're  still  waiting for the snow to fall
Doesn't  really  feel like  Christmas  at all

Still  waiting  for the snow to fall
It doesn't  really  feel like  Christmas  at all

Those  Christmas  lights
Light up the street
Down  where  the sea and city meet
May all your  troubles  soon be gone
Oh  Christmas  lights keep  shining  on

Those  Christmas  lights
Light up the street
Maybe they'll  bring  her back to me
Then all my  troubles  will be gone
Oh  Christmas  lights keep  shining  on

Oh  Christmas  lights
Light up the street
Light up the  fireworks  in me
May all your  troubles  soon be gone
Those  Christmas  lights keep  shining  on
Oh

Once upon a time  somebody  ran
Somebody ran away  saying  fast as I can
I've got to go, I've got to go!

Once upon a time we fell apart
You're  holding  in your  hands  the two  halves  of my heart
Oh, oh!

Oh

Once upon a time, we  burned  bright
Now all we ever seem to do is fight
On and on
And on and on and on

Once upon a time on the same side.
Once upon a time on the same side, in the same game
And why'd you have to go, have to go and  throw  water on my flame

I could've been a princess, you'd be a king
Could've had a castle, and worn a ring
But no, you let me go

I could've been a princess, you'd be a king
Could've had a castle, and worn a ring
But no, you let me go

And  stole  my star
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la 
You  stole  my star
La, la la la la la

Oh-oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh-oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

'Cause you  really  hurt me
No you  really  hurt me
'Cause you  really  hurt me
No you  really  hurt me
'Cause you  really  hurt me
Oh you  really  hurt me, oh
'Cause you  really  hurt me
Oh you  really  hurt me
Fixing up a car to  drive  in it again
Searching for the water,  hoping  for the rain
Up and up
Up and up

Down upon the canvas,  working  meal to meal
Waiting for a  chance  to pick your  orange  field
Up and up
Up and up

See a  pearl  form, a  diamond  in the rough
See a bird  soaring  high  above  the flood
It’s in your blood
It’s in your blood

Underneath the  storm  an  umbrella  is saying
Sitting with the  poison  takes away the pain
Up and up
Up and up, saying

We're  gonna  get it, get it  together  right now
Gonna get it, get it  together  somehow
Gonna get it, get it  together  and flower
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
We're  gonna  get it, get it  together  I know
Gonna get it, get it  together  and flow
Gonna get it, get it  together  and go
Up and up and up

Lying in the gutter,  aiming  for the moon
Trying to  empty  out the  ocean  with a spoon
Up and up
Up and up

See the  forest  staring at  every  seed
Angels in the  marble  waiting to be freed
Just need love
Just need love, when the  going  is  rough  saying

We're  gonna  get it, get it  together  right now
Gonna get it, get it  together  somehow
Gonna get it, get it  together  and flower
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
We're  gonna  get it, get it  together  I know
Gonna get it, get it  together  and flow
Gonna get it, get it  together  and go

And you can say what is, or  fight  for it
Close your mind and take a risk
You can "it's mine" and  clench  your fist
Or see each  other  as a gift

We're  gonna  get it, get it  together  right now
Gonna get it, get it  together  somehow
Gonna get it, get it  together  and flower
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
We're  gonna  get it, get it  together  I know
Gonna get it, get it  together  and flow
Gonna get it, get it  together  and go
Up and up and up

We're  gonna  get it, get it  together  right now
Gonna get it, get it  together  somehow
Gonna get it, get it  together  and flower
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
We're  gonna  get it, get it  together  I know
Gonna get it, get it  together  and flow
Gonna get it, get it  together  and go
Up and up

Fixing up a car to  drive  in it again
When you're in pain
When you  think  you've had enough

Don't ever give up
Sometimes I wake up when I'm  falling  asleep
I  think  that  maybe  the  curtains  are  closing  on me
But I wake up, yes I wake up smiling

[Chorus]
So what I feel fine
I'm okay, I've seen the  lighter  side of life
I'm  alright  I feel good
So ill go, ill try to  start  moving

Sometimes I wake up and I'm  falling  asleep
But I've got to get going, so much that I  wanted  to do
But I wake up smiling

And this  could  be my last chance
Of  saving  my innocence
And this  could  be my last chance
No more  keeping  my feet on the ground

Sometimes I feel the  chance  is surprising
Surprisingly good to be  moving  around
And I move, and I wake up smiling

[Chorus]

And this  could  be my last chance
Of  saving  my innocence
And this  could  be my last chance
No more  keeping  my feet on the ground

And there's  nothing  to keep them
Nothing to keep them down
And there's  nothing  to keep them
There's  nothing  to keep them down.
Love, I hope we get on 
I hope we can find a way 
Seeing it all 
Love, I hope we can be 
I hope I can find a way 
Of  letting  you see 
That I'm so easy to  please  
So easy 

Love, I hope we grow up 
I hope we can find a way 
Of  seeing  it all 
Love, I hope we can be 
I hope I can find a way 
Of  letting  you see 
That I'm so easy to  please  
So easy
The  cardboard  head I see
Has  found  its way to me
Its out and its out and its out
Making me cry
I  sleep  but I will not move
I'm too  scared  to  leave  my room
But I won't be defeated, oh no

[Chorus:]
What if cars don't go my way
And its sure to  spoil  my day?
But in  voices  loud and  clear  you say to me;
"Its only superstition
Its only your imagination
Its only all the  things  that you fear
And the  things  from  which  you can't escape"

Keep  clean  for the  thousandth  time
Stand  still  and wait in line
Some  numbers  are  better  than others
Oh no

[Chorus]

And its  making  me cry, and its  making  me cry
And I'm  slipping  away, I'm  slipping  away

Its only superstition, only your imagination
And its only superstition, only superstition.
I want to be  bigger  stronger  drive  a  faster  car
To take me  anywhere  in seconds
To take me  anywhere  I want to go
And  drive  around a  faster  car
I will  settle  for  nothing  less
I will  settle  for  nothing  less

I want to be  bigger  stronger  drive  a  faster  car
At the  touch  of a button
I can go  anywhere  I want to go
And  drive  around my  faster  car
I will  settle  for  nothing  less
I will  settle  for  nothing  less

I  think  I want to  change  my attitude
I  think  I want to  change  my oxygen
I  think  I want to  change  my air
My atmosphere
I want to choke

I want to be  bigger  stronger  drive  a  faster  car
To take me  anywhere  in seconds
To take me  anywhere  I want to go
And  drive  around my  faster  car
I will  settle  for  nothing  less
I will  settle  for  nothing  less

I  think  I need to  change  my attitude
I  think  I want to  change  my oxygen
I  think  I want to  change  my air
My atmosphere
I want to choke

Bigger better
Bigger and better
Bigger and better
Bigger  stronger  drive a  faster  car
At the  touch  of a button
I can go  anywhere  I want to go
Can  anybody  fly this thing
Before my head explodes
Or my head  starts  to ring

We've been  living  life
Inside a bubble
We've been  living  life
Inside a bubble

Confidence in you
Is  confidence  in me
Is  confidence  in high speed

Can  anybody  stop this thing
Before my head explodes
Or my head  starts  to ring

We've been  living  life
Inside a bubble
We've been  living  life
Inside a bubble

Confidence in you
Is  confidence  in me
Is  confidence  in high speed

High speed
High speed

High  speed  you on
High  speed  you on
High  speed  you on
High  speed  you on
See you lost your  trust  and you  never  should have, you  never  should have

I  awake  to find no  peace  of mind
I said how do you live as a fugitive
Down here  where  I  cannot  see so clear
I said, what do I know
Show me the  right  way to go

And the  spies  came out of the water
But you're  feeling  so bad 'cause you know
But the  spies  hide out in  every  corner
But you can't  touch  them no, 'cause they're all spies
They're all spies

I  awake  to see that no one is free
We're all fugitives
Look at the way we live
Down here, I  cannot  sleep from fear no
I said,  which  way do I turn
Oh I  forget  everything I learn

And the  spies  came out of the water
But you're  feeling  so bad 'cause you know
The  spies  hide out in  every  corner
But you can't  touch  them no
'Cause they're all spies
They're all spies

And if we all hide here
They're  going  to find us
And if we don't hide now
They're  going  to  catch  us  where  we sleep
And if we don't hide here
They're  going  to find us

And  spies  came out of the water
But you're  feeling  so good 'cause you know
Though  spies  hide out in  every  corner
They can't  touch  you no
'Cause they're just spies
They're just spies
They're just spies
They're just spies
They're just spies
Oh no I see
A  spider  web it's  tangled  up with me
And I lost my head
And  thought  of all the  stupid  things I said
Oh no what's this
A  spider  web and I'm  caught  in the middle
So I  turned  to run
The  thought  of all the  stupid  things I've done

And I  never  meant to  cause  you trouble
And and I  never  meant to do you wrong
And ah well if I ever  caused  you trouble
Oh no I  never  meant to do you harm

Oh no I see
A  spider  web and it's me in the middle
So I  twist  and turn
Here am I in my  little  bubble

Singing out
I  never  meant to  cause  you trouble
And I  never  meant to do you wrong
And ah well if I ever  caused  you trouble
And oh no I  never  meant to do you harm

They spun a web for me
They spun a web for me
They spun a web for me
I want to live life
Never be cruel
I want to live life
Be good to you

I want to fly
And  never  come down
And live my life
And have  friends  around

We  never  change do we, no, no
We  never  learn do we

So I want to live in a  wooden  house
I want to live life  always  be true
I want to live life and be good to you

I want to fly and  never  come down
And live my life
And have  friends  around

We  never  change do we
No no
We  never  learn do we

So I want to live in a  wooden  house
Where  making  more  friends  would be easy

Oh and I don't have a soul to save
Yes and I sin  every  single day

We  never  change do we
We  never  learn do we

So I want to live in a  wooden  house
Where  making  more  friends  would be easy
I want to live  where  the sun  comes  out
Look at the stars
Look how they  shine  for you
And  everything  you do
Yeah they were all yellow

I came along
I  wrote  a song for you
And all the  things  you do
And it was  called  yellow

So then I took my turn
Oh what a  thing  to have done
And it was all yellow

Your skin
Oh yeah your skin and bones
Turn into  something  beautiful
You know you know I love you so
You know I love you so

I swam across
I  jumped  across for you
Oh what a  thing  to do

'Cause you were all yellow
I drew a line
I drew a line for you

You only live twice, or so it seems
One life for yourself, and one for your dreams

You  drift  through the  years  and life  seems  tame
Till one  dream  appears and love is its name

And love is a  stranger  who'll  beckon  you on
Don't  think  of the  danger  or the  stranger  is gone

This  dream  is for you, so pay the price
Make one  dream  come true, you only live twice

Got to  spread  love around, got to  spread  it around

Brothers and  sisters  feel fine

There's no sound, no sound
Like this  feeling  you  found  like this  feeling  you found

Come on, oh my star is fading
And I  swerve  out of control
If I, if I'd only waited
I'd not be  stuck  here in this hole

Come here, oh my star is fading
And I  swerve  out of control
And I  swear  I  waited  and waited
I've got to get out of this hole

But time is on your side
It's on your side now
Not  pushing  you down and all around
It's no  cause  for concern

Come on, oh my star is fading
And I see no  chance  of release
And I know I'm dead on the surface
But I am  screaming  underneath

And time is on your side
Is on your side, It's on your side now
Not  pushing  you down, and all around
No it's no  cause  for concern

Stuck on the end of this ball and chain
And I'm on my way back down again
Stood on a bridge, tied to the noose
Sick to the stomach
You can say what you mean
But it won't  change  a thing
I'm sick of the secrets
Stood on the edge, tied to the noose

You came  along  and you cut me loose
You came  along  and you cut me loose
You came  along  and you cut me loose
The  lights  go out and I can't be saved
Tides that I  tried  to swim against
Have  brought  me down upon my knees
Oh I beg, I beg and plead, singing

Come out of the  things  unsaid
Shoot an  apple  off my head and then a
Trouble that can't be named
A tiger's  waiting  to be tamed, singing

You are, you are

Confusion that  never  stops
The  closing  walls and the  ticking  clocks gonna
Come back and take you home
I  could  not stop, that you now know, singing

Come out upon my seas
Cursed  missed  opportunities am I
A part of the cure
Or am I part of the disease, singing

You are, you are
You are, you are
You are, you are

And  nothing  else compares
Oh no  nothing  else compares
And  nothing  else compares

You are, you are

Home, home,  where  I  wanted  to go
Home, home,  where  I  wanted  to go
Home, home,  where  I  wanted  to go (you are)
Home, home,  where  I  wanted  to go (you are)
To my surprise, and my delight
I saw sunrise, I saw sunlight
I am  nothing  in the dark
And the  clouds  burst to show daylight

Oh and the sun will shine
Yeah on this  heart  of mine
Oh and I realize
Who  cannot  live without
Oh come  apart  without
It

On a hilltop, on a sky-rise
Like a  firstborn  child
And at full tilt, and in full flight
Defeat darkness,  breaking  daylight

Oh and the sun will shine
Yeah on this  heart  of mine
Oh and I realized
Who  cannot  live without
Oh and come  apart  without
Daylight

(Slowly  breaking  through daylight)
Where do we go  nobody  knows?
I've  gotta  say I'm on my way down
God give me  style  and give me grace

He said I'm  gonna  buy this  place  and  watch  it fall
Stand here  beside  me baby, in the  crumbling  walls
Oh, I'm  gonna  buy this  place  and  start  a fire
Stand here  until  I fill all your heart's desires
Because I'm  gonna  buy this  place  and see it burn

They said  start  as you mean to go on
Start as you mean to go on

So I'm  gonna  buy a gun and  start  a war

Running in circles,  coming  up tails
Heads on a  science  apart

Nobody said it was easy
It's such a  shame  for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it  would  be this hard
Oh take me back to the start

I was just  guessing  at  numbers  and figures
Pulling your  puzzles  apart
Questions of science,  science  and progress
Do not  speak  as loud as my heart

Tell me you love me
Come back and  haunt  me
Oh and I rush to the start
Running in circles,  chasing  our tails
Coming back as we are

Nobody said it was easy
Oh it's such a  shame  for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it  would  be so hard
I'm  going  back to the start

(Oh oh oh oh oh oh)

Through the  years  we all will be together
If the  fates  allow
So hang a  shining  star upon the  highest  bough
And have  yourself  a  merry  little  Christmas  now
Stuck in a  corner  
Are  monkeys  in  cages  
That don't have a  number  
To  fight  one  another  

Try to  recover  
Climb up the  ladder  
Look up and you see  birds  
Blind as each  other  
How long can we suffer? 

We're as  blind  as each  other  
On the  cloud  that you're  sitting  
There's one born  every  minute 
So much to  discover  
I've  become  a  believer  

Sisters and  brothers  
Who  fight  one  another  
Will  mourn  and  deceive  us 
Will find us and keep us 

Take us or  leave  us 
How soon is now? yeah 
How long is never? 
I'm  nothing  but  normal  
With  something  together 

Come on and  stick  together 
On the  cloud  that you're  sitting  
There's one born  every  minute 
So much to  discover  
I've  become  a believer
One, two, three... well
I ran away from you
That's all I ever do
And  though  I  started  here
I ran away from you

I'm  gonna  come on in
And see it through

I ran away from you
That's all I ever do

And when I  heard  you call to
Come back to me
And  though  I  should  stay
I don't have the  stomach  to

Everyone I know
Says I'm a fool mess with you
Everyone I know
Says it's a  stupid  thing to do

I have your love on call
And yet my day is not so full
There  might  be  nothing  left to do
So I ran away from you

I'm  gonna  come on in
My eyes are closed

I can feel it there
The sun's so close
I'm  gonna  come on out
And burn the sky

A star  arose  in my own cage
I'm  stuck  in line
And in a cage

Just a  single  star
I sing for

Everyone I know
Says I'm a fool mess with you
Everyone I know
Says it's a  stupid  thing to do

I have your love on call
And yet my day is not so full
And I did not know what to do
And so I ran away from you
Oh no I see
A  spider  web it's  tangled  up with me
And I lost my head
And  thought  of all the  stupid  things I said
Oh no what's this
A  spider  web and I'm  caught  in the middle
So I  turned  to run
The  thought  of all the  stupid  things I've done

And I  never  meant to  cause  you trouble
And and I  never  meant to do you wrong
And ah well if I ever  caused  you trouble
Oh no I  never  meant to do you harm

Oh no I see
A  spider  web and it's me in the middle
So I  twist  and turn
Here am I in my  little  bubble

Singing out
I  never  meant to  cause  you trouble
And I  never  meant to do you wrong
And ah well if I ever  caused  you trouble
And oh no I  never  meant to do you harm

They spun a web for me
They spun a web for me
They spun a web for me
Tie me to a tree
Tie my  hands  above my head
Sing a song to me
Sing a song like what you said

Cause they're  gonna  murder me
They're  gonna  take me down
Something
I  crumble  down

Come spit at us
Come and  throw  your  weight  around
Come and  fight  with us
Come and rock me to the ground

Cause they're  gonna  murder me
They're  gonna  take me down
Something
I  crumble  down

So what can it  possibly  be?
Oh what can it  possibly  be?
Oh what can it  possibly  be?
Animals we are
Disposable
Collapsible and raw
I suppose
It's just the  state  I'm in
Animals that climb
I'm climbin' over you
Until you say
"Off you go, off you go"

Animal I am
Disposable
Collapsible and raw
I don't know  which  way
I  should  turn

Animal that runs
I ran away from you
And now I'm in
"Off you go, off you go"
(And you say)

If you're  gonna  go, go now
If you're  gonna  go, go now
I  forgot  to tell you how
If you  gonna  go, go now

Animal I am
I'm  looking  for a future
Just like you
Well I don't know
Which way I turn

Animals that climb
I  climb  all over you
Until I say
And I  missed  my chance
By a  stone  slow

If you're  gonna  go
Go now
If you're  gonna  go
Go now
I  forgot  to tell you how
If you  gonna  go
Go now
The  lights  go out and I can't be saved
Tides that I  tried  to swim against
Have  brought  me down upon my knees
Oh I beg, I beg and plead, singing

Come out of the  things  unsaid
Shoot an  apple  off my head and a
Trouble that can't be named
A tiger's  waiting  to be tamed, singing

You are, you are

Confusion that  never  stops
The  closing  walls and the  ticking  clocks gonna
Come back and take you home
I  could  not stop, that you now know, singing

Come out upon my seas
Cursed  missed  opportunities am I
A part of the cure
Or am I part of the disease, singing

You are, you are
You are, you are
You are, you are

And  nothing  else compares
And  nothing  else compares
And  nothing  else compares

You are, you are

Home, home,  where  I  wanted  to go
Home, home,  where  I  wanted  to go
Home, home,  where  I  wanted  to go (You are)
Home, home,  where  I  wanted  to go (You are)
It  could  be worse, I  could  be alone
I  could  be  locked  in here on my own

Or like a  stone  that  suddenly  drops
It  never  stops, no

I  could  be lost or I  could  be saved
Calling out from  beneath  the waves
Beaten down by the  social  raves

Never again;  never  again

Oooooo Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Oooooo Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Oooooo Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
I'm screamin' out from the  crests  of waves

It  could  be worse; it's all sweet
It  could  be  snapped  from the jaws of defeat
Or like a  light  lit up on the beach
You wear your  heart  on your sleeve, Ohhhh

You want to stop  before  you begin
You want to sink when you know you  could  swim
You want to stop just  before  you begin
Never give in;  never  give in

Oooooo Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Oooooo Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Oooooo Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
I'm screamin' out from the  crests  of waves

Oooooo Nothin' matters
Except not for the love we make
Ooooooooooo

Nothin' matters
Ooooooooooo
Except not for the love we make

Nothin' matters
Ooooooooooo
Except not for the love we make

Aaaahhhhhh
Except not for the love we make

Oooooo Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Oooooo Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Oooooo Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
I'm screamin' out from the  crests  of waves

Oooooo Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Oooooo Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Oooooo Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
I'm screamin' out from the  crests  of waves
Where you're  longing  to be saved

I'm screamin' out from the  crests  of waves
Where you're  longing  to be saved
I'm screamin' out from the  crests  of waves
In my place, in my place
Were  lines  that I couldn't change
I was lost, oh yeah 

I was lost, I was lost
Crossed  lines  I shouldn't have crossed
I was lost, oh yeah 

Yeah how long must you wait for it?
Yeah how long must you pay for it?
Yeah how long must you wait for it?
Oh for it

I was scared, I was scared
Tired and  under  prepared
But I wait for it

If you go, if you go
Leave me down here on my own
Then I'll wait for you (yeah)

Yeah how long must you wait for it?
Yeah how long must you pay for it?
Yeah how long must you wait for it?
Oh for it

Sing it, please, please, please
Come back and sing to me, to me, me 
Come on and sing it out, now, now
Come on and sing it out, to me, me
Come back and sing it 

In my place, in my place
Were  lines  that I couldn't change
And I was lost, oh yeah, oh yeah
She  floats  like a swan
Grace on the water
Lips like sugar
Lips like sugar

Just when you  think  you've  caught  her 
She  glides  across the  water  
She  calls  for you  tonight  
To  share  this  moonlight  

She'll flow down your  river  
And ask him and she'll give you

Lips like  sugar  
Sugar  kisses  
Lips like  sugar  
Sugar  kisses  

She  knows  what she knows
I know what she's thinking
Sugar kisses
Sugar kisses

Just when you  think  she's  yours  
She's  flown  to  other  shores 
To  laugh  at how you  break  
To melt into this lake 

She'll flow down your  river  
And ask him and she'll give you

Lips like  sugar  
Sugar  kisses  
Lips like  sugar  
Sugar  kisses  

She'll be my  mirror  
Reflect what I am 
A  loser  and a  winner  
The King of Siam 
And my  Siamese  twin 
She  knows  what I'm thinking
???

She'll flow down your  river  
And ask him and she'll give you

Lips like  sugar  
Sugar  kisses  
Lips like  sugar  
Sugar kisses
Come on now, don't you want to see?
This  thing  that's  happening  to me
Like  Moses  has  power  over sea
So you've got  power  over me 

Come on now, don't you want to know?
You're a refuge,  somewhere  I can go
You're air that, air that I can breathe
Cause you're my  golden  opportunity 

And oh, oh yes I would
If I only could
And you know I would
And baby I, oh baby I
I wish 

Come on now, don't you want to see?
Just what a  difference  you've made in me
I'll be  waiting  oh no  matter  what you say
Cause I've been  waiting  for days, days, days 

And oh, oh yes I would
If I only could
And you know I would
And baby I, oh baby I
I wish
I wish 

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
If the sky's  gonna  fall down, let it fall on me
If you're  gonna  break down, you can  break  on me
If the sky's  gonna  fall down, let it fall on me
If it's  gonna  rain down, it can rain on me
It can rain on me
Look at  earth  from  outer  space
Everyone must find a place
Give me time and give me space
Give me real, don't give me fake
Give me strength,  reserve  control
Give me  heart  and give me soul
Give me time, give us a kiss
Tell me your own politik

Open up your eyes
Open up your eyes
Open up your eyes
Just open up your eyes

Give me one,  cause  one is best
In confusion, confidence
Give me  piece  of mind and trust
Don't  forget  the rest of us

Give me strength,  reserve  control
Give me  heart  and give me soul
Wounds that heal and  cracks  that fix
Tell me your own politik

Open up your eyes
Open up your eyes
Open up your eyes
Just open up your eyes

And give me love over, love over, love over this, ah
And give me love over, love over, love over this, ah
Where do we go  nobody  knows?
I've  gotta  say I'm on my way down
God give me  style  and give me grace
God put a  smile  upon my face

Where do we go to draw the line?
I've  gotta  say
I  wasted  all your time,  honey  honey
Where do I go to fall from grace?
God put a  smile  upon your face
Yeah

Now when you work it out I'm  worse  than you
Yeah when you work it out I  wanted  to
Now when you work out  where  to draw the line
Your  guess  is as good as mine

Where do we go  nobody  knows?
Don't ever say you're on your way down when
God gave you  style  and gave you grace
And put a  smile  upon your face
Ah yeah

Now when you work it out I'm  worse  than you
Yeah when you work it out I  wanted  to
Now when you work out  where  to draw the line
Your  guess  is as good as mine

It's as good as mine
It's as good as mine
It's as good as mine
As good as mine
As good as mine
As good as mine
As good as mine

Where do we go  nobody  knows?
Don't ever say you're on your way down when
God gave you  style  and gave you grace
And put a  smile  upon your face
I  jumped  in the  river  and what did I see?
Black-eyed  angels  swam with me
A moon full of  stars  and  astral  cars
All the  things  I used to see
All my  lovers  were  there  with me
All my past and futures
And we all went to  heaven  in a  little  row boat
There was  nothing  to fear and  nothing  to doubt

There was  nothing  to fear and  nothing  to doubt

There was  nothing  to fear and  nothing  to  doubt  
There was  nothing  to fear and  nothing  to doubt
I'll keep it in my head till I know I
Until I know that I can  leave  your doorstep
Until I know the  conversations  cold
I'll hide it in the  words  until I know I
Until I know that I can be  alone  here
Until I know the  consequences  known

We're all in love with  something  that we can't see
We're all in love with  something  that we can't see
I'm in love with  something  that we can't see
I'm in love with  someone  that we can't see

I'll  throw  you out and  bring  you back later
Everything I see's a complication
Everyone I  known  has come and go
I've  fallen  in the  reason  for the passion
Everyone  needs  something for  their  hands when
When they know they're  gonna  be alone

We're all in love with  something  that we can't see
We're all in love with  something  that we can't see
I'm in love with  something  that we can't see
I'm in love with  someone  that we can't see

I'm  looking  for  something  to shout
Something I know I  cannot  doubt
I'm  looking  for  something  to shout
Something I know I  cannot  doubt
Come on won't help me out

We're all in love with  something  that we can't see
We're all in love with  something  that we can't see
I'm in love with  something  that we can't see
I'm in love with  someone  that we can't see

I'm in love  without  you
I'm in love  without  you 
I'm in love  without  you 
I'm in love  without  you

We're all in love with  something  that we can't see
We're all in love with  something  that we can't see
I'm in love with  something  that we can't see
I'm in love with  someone  that we can't see
When you try your best but you don't  succeed  
When you get what you want but not what you need 
When you feel so  tired  but you can't  sleep  
Stuck in  reverse  

When the  tears  come  streaming  down your face 
When you lose  something  you can't  replace  
When you love  someone  but it goes to  waste  
Could it be worse? 

Lights will  guide  you home 
And  ignite  your  bones  
And I will try to fix you 

High up  above  or down  below  
When you're too in love to let it go 
If you  never  try you'll  never  know 
Just what you're  worth  

Lights will  guide  you home 
And  ignite  your  bones  
And I will try to fix you 

Tears come  streaming  down your face
When you lose  something  you  cannot  replace
Tears come  streaming  down your face
And I

Tears come  streaming  down your face
I  promise  you I will  learn  from all my mistakes
Tears come  streaming  down your face
And I

Lights will  guide  you home 
And  ignite  your  bones  
And I will try to fix you
Pour me
Floatin' out to see
An  opportunity  that went by

Pour you
Now what you  gonna  do?
Now what you  gonna  do? 
You just cry

Pour me, so  blind  I couldn't see
The  flowers  or the trees, I don't know why

Pour you
You  split  yourself in two
Now what you  gonna  do?
You just cry

I hear you
Come nearer
I hear you but I don't understand

I hear you 
Come  nearer  
I hear you but I don't understand

Pour me
Floating out to see
An  opportunity  that went by

Pour you
Now what you  gonna  do?
Now what you  gonna  do? 
You just cry

I hear you
Come nearer
I hear you, but I don't understand

I hear you 
Come  nearer  
I hear you but I don't understand

I don't understand
I don't understand
X and why
The land, sea, rivers, trees
The stars, the sky
That and this
We're part of a  bigger  plan
Don't know what it is
Don't know what it is

You and me
The land, sun, trees, the sky
The stars, the sea
Three  hundred  and  sixty  five degrees
I am the puzzle, you're the  missing  piece
Hang on a minute, just a minute, please
I'll come
And  everything  under the sun
And  everything  under the sun

What is this  feeling  that I can't explain?
And why am I  never  gonna  sleep  again?
What is this  thing  I've  never  seen before?
A  little  boy lost in a  breaking  storm

Pilots up, and away they fly
Some  write  your name in the  summer  sky
Life has  really  only just begun
Life, it comes
And  everything  under the sun

X is why
The land, sea, rivers, trees
The stars, the sky
Three  hundred  and  sixty  five degrees
All of the  surface  and the underneath
Searching the  measures  in this  extra  key, ah
And  everything  under the sun
And  everything  under the sun

What is this  feeling  that I can't explain?
And why am I  never  gonna  sleep  again?
What is this  thing  I've  never  seen before?
A  little  boy lost in a  breaking  storm

Pilots up, and away they fly
Some  write  your name in the  summer  sky
Life has  really  only just begun
Life, it comes
And  everything  under the sun

And you don't know that you've been born
Can't see the calm  until  the storm
Can't tell your  right  side from your wrong
Can't see the wave you're  riding  on...
Anything we  should  know  about  your change? 
They put the  world  in a tin can 
Black  market  contraband 
And it hurt just a  little  bit when they  sliced  and  packaged  it
In a long  black  trench coat 
Two  hands  around the  throat  
Ooh you want to get it  right  sometimes 

There's so much to be  scared  of 
And not much to make  sense  of 
How did the  clowns  ever get control? 
If your hear can you let me know 
How can they  invade  it when it's so complicated? 
Ooh you just want to get it  right  sometimes 
You just want to get it  right  sometimes 

That's how you see the  world  
How many  times  can you say you can't  believe  what you  learn  
That's how you see the  world  don't you  worry  yourself 
You're not  gonna  give up. 

And there's  something  missing  seems  like there's  nobody  listening 
If you're  running  in a  circle  how can you be too careful? 
We don't  wanna  be man  trapped  we don't  wanna  be  shrink  wrapped 
Ooh we just want to get it  right  sometimes 
Just want to get it  right  sometimes 

That's how you see the  world  
How many  times  have you  heard  but you can't  believe  a word 
That's how you see the  world  but don't you  worry  yourself 
'Cause  nobody  can hurt you 

That's how you see the  world  
That's how you see the world
So I  waited  for you
What wouldn't I do?
And I'm  covered  it's true
I'm  covered  in you

If I ever want proof
I find it in you
Yeah I  honestly  do
In you I find proof

Light, dark
Bright spark
Light, dark, and then light

So I  waited  all day
What wouldn't I say
And all the  thing  in you way
Things  happen  that way

And if I ever want proof
Then I find it in you
Yeah I  honestly  do
In you I find proof

Light, dark
Bright spark
Light, dark, and then light

Light, light, light... light...
How  tides  control the sea, and what  becomes  of me
How  little  things can slip out of your hands
How  often  people change, no two  remain  the same
Why  things  don't  always  turn out as you plan

These are  things  that I don't understand
Yeah,  these  are  things  that I don't understand

I can't, and I can't decide
Wrong, all my  wrong  from right
Day, all my day for night
Dark, all my dark for light
I live, but I love this life

How  infinite  is space, and who  decides  your fate
Why  everything  will  dissolve  into sand
How to  avoid  defeat, when  truth  and  fiction  meet
Why  nothing  even  turns  out how you planned

These are  things  that I don't understand
Yeah,  these  are  things  that I don't understand

I can't, and I can't decide
Wrong, all my  wrong  from right
Day, all my day for night
Or dark, all my dark for light
I live, but I love this life
You're in  control  
Is  there  anywhere you want to go? 
You're in  control  
Is  there  anything you want to know? 
The future's for  discovering  
The  space  in  which  we're  traveling  

From the top of the  first  page 
To the end of the last day 
From the  start  in your own way 
You just want  somebody  listening to what you say 
It doesn't  matter  who you are 
It doesn't  matter  who you are 

Under the  surface  trying to  break  through 
Deciphering the  codes  in you 
I need a compass, draw me a map 
I'm on the top, I can't get back 

Whoa whoa 

The  first  line on the  first  page 
To the end of the last page 
From the  start  in your own way 
You just want  somebody  listening to what you say 
It doesn't  matter  who you are 
It doesn't  matter  who you are 

You just want 
Somebody  listening  to what you say 
Oh, you just want  somebody  listening to what you say 
It doesn't  matter  who you are 
It doesn't  matter  who you are 

Is  there  anybody out  there  who 
Is lost and hurt and  lonely  too 
Are they  bleeding  all your  colors  into one? 
And if you come  undone  
As if you've been run  through  
Some  catapult  it  fired  you 
You  wonder  if your  chance  will ever come 
Or if you're  stuck  in  square  one
Climb up your mountain,  nineteen  and countin'
You have got seven, I have got one
Blinded and hurtin', this I'm deserving
I've got my secrets, you've only got the  sleeping  sun

When you've got a  secret  then you've got to keep it
When you have a question,  answers  will come
Running and hiding, take and dividing
You've got your secrets, I've only got a  sleeping  sun

Sleeping sun
Singing
Ooh, ooh, ohh, ohh
Ahh, ohh, ahh, ohh

And you, as I saw, a  piece  in a jigsaw
Run up and  around  it and jump up real tall
Run  round  the  houses  north and the  south  is
You've got your answers, we've only got a  sleeping  sun

Sleeping sun
Singing
Ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh
Ahh, ohh, ahh, ohh
One, two
Steal my  heart  and hold my tongue
I feel my time, my time has come
Let me in,  unlock  the door
I  never  felt this way before

And the  wheels  just keep on turning
The  drummer  begins to drum
I don't know  which  way I'm going
I don't know  which  way I've come

Hold my head  inside  your hands
I need  someone  who understands
I need someone,  someone  who hears
For you, I've  waited  all  these  years

For you I'd wait 'til  kingdom  come
Until my day, my day is done
And say you'll come and set me free
Just say you'll wait, you'll wait for me

In your  tears  and in your blood
In your fire and in your flood
I hear you laugh, I  heard  you sing
I wouldn't  change  a  single  thing

And the  wheels  just keep on turning
The  drummers  begin to drum
I don't know  which  way I'm going
I don't know what I'll become

For you I'd wait 'til  kingdom  come
Until my days, my days are done
And say you'll come and set me free
Just say you'll wait, you'll wait for me

Just say you'll wait, you'll wait for me
Just say you'll wait, you'll wait for me
Oh brother, I can't, I can't get through
I've been  trying  hard to  reach  you 'cause I don' know what to do
Oh brother, I can't  believe  it's true
I'm so  scared  about the future, and I  wanna  talk to you
Oh, I  wanna  talk to you

You can take a  picture  of  something  you see
In the  future  where will I be?
You can  climb  a  ladder  up to the sun
Or a  write  a song  nobody  has sung
Or do  something  that's  never  been done

Are you lost or incomplete?
Do you feel like a puzzle, you can't find your  missing  piece?
Tell me, how do you feel?
Well, I feel like they're  talking  in a  language  I don't speak
And they're  talking  it to me

So you take a  picture  of  something  you see
In the  future  where will I be?
You can  climb  a  ladder  up to the sun
Or  write  a song  nobody  has sung
Or do  something  that's  never  been done
Or do  something  that's  never  been done

So you don't know  where  you're  going  and you  wanna  talk
And you feel like you're  going  where you've been before
You tell  anyone  who'll listen, but you feel ignored
Nothing's  really  making any  sense  at all, let's talk
Let's talk, let's talk, let's talk
You cut me down a tree
And  brought  it back to me
And that's what made me see
Where I was  going  wrong

You put me on a shelf
And kept me for yourself
I can only  blame  myself
You can only  blame  me

And I  could  write a song
A  hundred  miles long
Well, that's  where  I belong
And you  belong  with me

And I  could  write it down
Or  spread  it all around
Get lost and then get found
Or  swallowed  in the sea

You put me on a line
And hung me out to dry
And  darling  that's when I
Decided to go to see you

You cut me down to size
And  opened  up my eyes
Made me realize
What I  could  not see

And I  could  write a book
The one they'll say that shook
The world, and then it took
It took it back from me

And I  could  write it down
Or  spread  it all around
Get lost and then get found
And you'll come back to me
Not  swallowed  in the sea

Ooh...

And I  could  write a song
A  hundred  miles long
Well, that's  where  I belong
And you  belong  with me

The  streets  you're  walking  on
A  thousand  houses long
Well, that's  where  I belong
And you  belong  with me

Oh what good is it to live
With  nothing  left to give
Forget but not forgive
Not  loving  all you see

All the  streets  you're  walking  on
A  thousand  houses long
Well that's  where  I belong
And you  belong  with me
Not  swallowed  in the sea

You  belong  with me
Not  swallowed  in the sea
Yeah, you  belong  with me
Not  swallowed  in the sea
Honey
It's been a long time coming
And I can't stop now
Such a long time running
And I can't stop now
Do you hear my  heart  beating?
Can you hear that sound?
'Cause I can't help thinking
I don't look down

And then I  looked  up at the sun
And I  could  see
Oh, the way that  gravity  turns for you and me
And then I  looked  up at the sky
And saw the sun
And the way that  gravity  turns on everyone
On everyone

Baby
It's been a long time waiting
Such a long, long time
And I can't stop smiling
Oh I can't stop now
Do you hear my  heart  beating?
Oh, do you hear that sound?
'Cause I can't stop crying
And I won't look down

And then I  looked  up at the sun
And I  could  see
Oh, the way that  gravity  turns on you and me
And then I  looked  up at the sun
And saw the sky
And the way that  gravity  pulls on you and I
On you and I
And the  hardest  part
Was  letting  go, not  taking  part
Was the  hardest  part

And the  strangest  thing
Was  waiting  for that bell to ring
It was the  strangest  start

I  could  feel it go down
Bittersweet I  could  taste in my mouth
Silver  lining  the  cloud  
Oh and I
I wish that I  could  work it out

And the  hardest  part
Was  letting  go, not  taking  part
You  really  broke my heart

And I  tried  to sing 
But I couldn't  think  of anything
And that was the  hardest  part

I  could  feel it go down
You left the  sweetest  taste in my mouth
You're  silver  lining the clouds
Oh and I
Oh and I
I  wonder  what it's all about
I  wonder  what it's all about

Everything I know is wrong
Everything I do, it's just  comes  undone
And  everything  is torn apart

Oh and it's the part
That's the  hardest  part 
Yeah that's the  hardest  part
That's the  hardest  part
When you try your best but you don't succeed
When you get what you want but not what you need
When you feel so  tired  but you can't sleep
Stuck in reverse

When the  tears  come  streaming  down your face
When you lose  something  you can't replace
When you love  someone  but it goes to waste
Could it be worse?

Lights will  guide  you home
And  ignite  your bones
And I will try to fix you

High up  above  or down below
When you're too in love to let it go
If you  never  try you'll  never  know
Just what you're worth

Lights will  guide  you home
And  ignite  your bones
And I will try to fix you

Tears  stream  down your face
When you lose  something  you  cannot  replace
Tears  stream  down your face
And I

Tears  stream  down your face
I  promise  you I will  learn  from all my mistakes
Tears  stream  down your face
And I

Lights will  guide  you home
And  ignite  your bones
And I will try to fix you
And the  hardest  part
Was  letting  go, not  taking  part
Was the  hardest  part

And the  strangest  thing
Was  waiting  for that bell to ring
It was the  strangest  start

I  could  feel it go down
Bittersweet I  could  taste in my mouth
Silver  lining  the cloud
Oh and I
I wish that I  could  work it out

And the  hardest  part
Was  letting  go, not  taking  part
You  really  broke my heart, oh

And I  tried  to sing
But I couldn't  think  of anything
And that was the  hardest  part, oh

I  could  feel it go down
You left the  sweetest  taste in my mouth
You're  silver  lining the clouds
Oh and I
Oh and I
I  wonder  what it's all about
I  wonder  what it's all about

Everything I know is wrong
Everything I do, it's just  comes  undone
And  everything  is torn apart

Oh and it's the  hardest  part
That's the  hardest  part
Yeah that's the  hardest  part
That's the  hardest  part
You see the  world  in  black  and white
No  color  or life
You  think  you'll  never  get it right
But you're wrong, you might

The sky  could  fall,  could  fall on me
The  parting  of the seas
But you mean more, mean more to me
Than any  color  I can see

All you ever  wanted  was love
But you  never  looked hard enough
It's  never  gonna give  itself  up
All you ever  wanted  to be
Living in  perfect  symmetry
Nothing is as down or as up
As us

You see the  world  in  black  and white
Nothing too bright
You see no  meaning  to your life
Yes you try
Yes you try

And all you ever  wanted  was love
But you  never  looked hard enough
It's  never  gonna give  itself  up
And all you ever  wanted  to be
Living in  perfect  symmetry
Nothing is as down or as up

And don't you want to see it come soon
Floating in a big  white  balloon
Or  given  your own  silver  spoon

Don't you want to see it come down
Enough of  throwing  your arms around
And  saying  not a  moment  too soon

'Cause I feel low
'Cause I feel low
Ooh
Yeah I feel low
Oh no
Oh ooh
'Cause I feel low
'Cause I feel low
Ooh
And I feel low
Oh no
Ooh
My song is love
Love to the  lovers  shone
And it goes up
You don't have to be alone

Your  heavy  heart
Is made of stone
And it's so hard to see you,  clearly  
You don't have to be on your own
You don't have to be on your own

And I'm not  gonna  take it back
And I'm not  gonna  say I don't mean that
You're the  target  that I'm  aiming  at
And I'll get that  message  home

My song is love
My song is love I know
And I'm on fire for you,  clearly  
You don't have to be alone
You don't have to be on your own

And I'm not  gonna  take it back
And I'm not  gonna  say I don't mean that
You're the  target  that I'm  aiming  at
But I'm  nothing  on my own
Got to get that  message  home

And I'm not  gonna  stand and wait
Not  gonna  leave it  until  its much too late
On a  platform  I'm  gonna  stand and say
That I'm  nothing  on my own
And I love you,  please  come home

My song is love, is love I know
And I've got to get that  message  home
How long  before  I get in?
Before it starts,  before  I begin?
How long  before  you decide?
Before I know what it  feels  like?

Where to,  where  do I go?
If you  never  try, then you'll  never  know
How long do I have to climb
Up on the side of this  mountain  of mine?

Look up, I look up at night
Planets are  moving  at the  speed  of light
Climb up, up in the trees
Every  chance  that you get
Is a  chance  you seize
How long am I  gonna  stand
With my head  stuck  under the sand?
I'll  start  before I can stop
Before I see  things  the  right  way up

All that noise, and all that sound
All  those  places I have found
And  birds  go  flying  at the  speed  of sound
To show you how it all began
Birds came  flying  from the underground
If you  could  see it then you'd understand

Ideas that you'll  never  find
All the  inventors  could  never  design
The  buildings  that you put up
Japan and  China  all lit up
The sign that I couldn't read
Or a  light  that I couldn't see
Some  things  you have to believe
But  others  are puzzles,  puzzling  me

All that noise, and all that sound
All  those  places I have found
And  birds  go  flying  at the  speed  of sound
To show you how it all began
Birds came  flying  from the underground
If you  could  see it then you'd understand
Ah when you see it then you'll understand

All  those  signs, I knew what they meant
Some  things  you can invent
And some get made, and some get sent
Ooh ooh

Birds go  flying  at the  speed  of sound
To show you how it all began
Birds came  flying  from the underground
If you  could  see it then you'd understand
Ah, when you see it then you'll understand
You're in control
Is  there  anywhere you want to go?
You're in control
Is  there  anything you want to know?
The future's for discovering
The  space  in  which  we're traveling

From the top of the  first  page
To the end of the last day
From the  start  in your own way
You just want  somebody  listening to what you say
It doesn't  matter  who you are

Under the  surface  trying to  break  through
Deciphering the  codes  in you
I need a compass, draw me a map
I'm on the top, I can't get back

Whoa whoa

The  first  line on the  first  page
To the end of the last page
From the  start  in your own way
You just want  somebody  listening to what you say
It doesn't  matter  who you are
It doesn't  matter  who you are

You just want
Somebody  listening  to what you say
Oh, you just want  somebody  listening to what you say
It doesn't  matter  who you are
It doesn't  matter  who you are

Is  there  anybody out  there  who
Is lost and hurt and  lonely  too
Are they  bleeding  all your  colors  into one?
And if you come undone
As if you've been run through
Some  catapult  it  fired  you
You  wonder  if your  chance  will ever come
Or if you're  stuck  in  square  one
You cut me down a tree
And  brought  it back to me
And that's what made me see
Where I was  going  wrong
You put me on a shelf
And kept me for yourself
I can only  blame  myself
You can only  blame  me

And I  could  write a song
A  hundred  miles long
Well, that's  where  I belong
And you  belong  with me

And I  could  write it down
Or  spread  it all around
Get lost and then get found
Or  swallowed  in the sea

You put me on a line
And hung me out to dry
And  darling  that's when I
Decided to go to sea

You cut me down to size
And  opened  up my eyes
Made me realize
What I  could  not see

And I  could  write a book
The one they'll say that shook
The world, and then it took
It took it back from me

And I  could  write it down
Or  spread  it all around
Get lost and then get found
And you'll come back to me
Not  swallowed  in the sea

Ooh, ooh

And I  could  write a song
A  hundred  miles long
Well, that's  where  I belong
And you  belong  with me

The  streets  you're  walking  on
A  thousand  houses long
Well, that's  where  I belong
And you  belong  with me

Oh what good is it to live
With  nothing  left to give
Forget but not forgive
Not  loving  all you see

Oh the  streets  you're  walking  on
A  thousand  houses long
Well that's  where  I belong
And you  belong  with me
Not  swallowed  in the sea

You  belong  with me
Not  swallowed  in the sea
Yeah, you  belong  with me
Not  swallowed  in the sea
Oh brother, I can't, I can't get through
I've been  trying  hard to  reach  you 'cause I don' know what to do
Oh brother, I can't  believe  it's true
I'm so  scared  about the future, and I  wanna  talk to you
Oh, I  wanna  talk to you

You can take a  picture  of  something  you see
In the  future  where will I be?
You can  climb  a  ladder  up to the sun
Or a  write  a song  nobody  has sung
Or do  something  that's  never  been done

Are you lost or incomplete?
Do you feel like a puzzle, you can't find your  missing  piece?
Tell me, how do you feel?
Well, I feel like they're  talking  in a  language  I don't speak
And they're  talking  it to me

So you take a  picture  of  something  you see
In the  future  where will I be?
You can  climb  a  ladder  up to the sun
Or  write  a song  nobody  has sung
Or do  something  that's  never  been done
Or do  something  that's  never  been done

So you don't know  where  you're  going  and you  wanna  talk
And you feel like you're  going  where you've been before
You tell  anyone  who'll listen, but you feel ignored
Nothing's  really  making any  sense  at all, let's talk
Let's talk, let's talk, let's talk
Steal my  heart  and hold my tongue
I feel my time, my time has come
Let me in,  unlock  the door
I've  never  felt this way before

And the  wheels  just keep on turning
The  drummer  begins to drum
I don't know  which  way I'm going
I don't know  which  way I've come

Hold my head  inside  your hands
I need  someone  who understands
I need someone,  someone  who hears
For you, I've  waited  all  these  years

For you I'd wait 'til  kingdom  come
Until my day, my day is done
And say you'll come and set me free
Just say you'll wait, you'll wait for me

In your  tears  and in your blood
In your fire and in your flood
I hear you laugh, I  heard  you sing
I wouldn't  change  a  single  thing

And the  wheels  just keep on turning
The  drummers  begin to drum
I don't know  which  way I'm going
I don't know what I'll become

For you I'd wait 'til  kingdom  come
Until my days, my days are done
And say you'll come and set me free
Just say you'll wait, you'll wait for me

Just say you'll wait, you'll wait for me
Just say you'll wait, you'll wait for me
What if  there  was no lie
Nothing wrong,  nothing  right
What if  there  was no time
And no reason, or rhyme
What if you  should  decide
That you don't want me  there  by your side
That you don't want me  there  in your life

What if I got it wrong
And no poem or song
Could put  right  what I got wrong
Or make you feel I belong

What if you  should  decide
That you don't want me  there  by your side
That you don't want me  there  in you life

Oooooooh that's right
Let's take a  breath  try to put it aside
Ooooooh that's right
How can you know it if you don't even try
Ooooooh that's right

Every step that you take
Could be your  biggest  mistake
It  could  bend or it  could  break
That's the risk that you take

What if you  should  decide
That you don't want me  there  in your life
That you don't want me  there  by your side

Oooooooh that's right
Let's take a  breath  try to put it aside
Ooooooh that's right
How can you know when you don't even try
Ooooooh that's right
When I was a  young  boy I  tried  to listen
And I want to feel like that
Little  white  shadows  blink  and I  missed  em
Part of a system, a plan

If you ever feel like something's missing
Things you'll  never  understand
Little  white  shadows  sparkle  and glisten
Part of a  system  plan

All this noise, I'm  waking  up
All this  space  I'm  taking  up
All this  sound  is  breaking  up

Whoa oh

Maybe you'll get what you wanted
Maybe you'll  stumble  upon it
Everything you ever wanted
In a  permanent  state

Maybe you'll know when you see it
Maybe if you say it you'll mean it
And when you find it you'll keep it
In a  permanent  state
A  permanent  state

When I was a  young  boy I  tried  to listen
Don't you want to feel like that

You're part of the  human  race
All of the  stars  and the  outer  space
Part of the  system  plan

All this noise, I'm  waking  up
All this  space  I'm  taking  up
I  cannot  hear, you're  breaking  up

Whoa oh

Maybe you'll get what you wanted
Maybe you'll  stumble  upon it
Everything you ever wanted
In a  permanent  state

Maybe you'll know when you see it
Maybe if you say it, you'll mean it
And when you find it you'll keep it
In a  permanent  state
A  permanent  state

Swimming on a sea of faces
A tide of the  human  race
So, an  answer  now is what I need

I see it in the new sun rising
I see it  break  on your horizon
Oh come on love, stay with me
Trying hard to  speak  and
Fighting with my weak hand
Driven to distraction
It's all part of the plan
When  something  is broken
And you try to fix it
Trying to  repair  it
Any way you can

I dive in at the deep end
You  become  my best friend
I want to love you but I don't know if I can
I know  something  is broken
And I'm  trying  to fix it
Trying to  repair  it
Any way I can

Ooh

You and me are  floating  on a  tidal  wave
Together
You and me are  drifting  into  outer  space
And singing
Ooh, ooh

You and me are  floating  on a  tidal  wave
Together
You and me are  drifting  into  outer  space

You and me are  floating  on a  tidal  wave
Together
You and me are  drifting  into  outer  space
And singing
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
So I  waited  for you
What wouldn't I do?
And I'm  covered  it's true
I'm  covered  in you

If I ever want proof
I find it in you
Yeah I  honestly  do
In you I find proof

Light and dark
Bright, spark
Light and dark, and then light

So I  waited  all day
What wouldn't I say
And all the  things  in your way
Things  happen  that way

oh oh, if I ever want proof
Then I find it in you, oh oh
Yeah I  honestly  do
In you I find proof

Light and dark
Bright, spark
Light and dark, and then light

Light, light, light, light

How  tides  control the sea, and what  becomes  of me
How  little  things can slip out of your hands
How  often  people change, no two  remain  the same
Why  things  don't  always  turn out as you plan

These are  things  that I don't understand
Yeah,  these  are  things  that I don't understand

I can't, and I can't decide
Wrong, all my  wrong  from right
Day, all my day for night
Dark, all my dark for light
I live, but I love this life

How  infinite  is space, and who  decides  your fate
Why  everything  will  dissolve  into sand
How to  avoid  defeat, when  truth  and  fiction  meet
Why  nothing  ever  turns  out as she planned

These are  things  that I don't understand
Yeah,  these  are  things  that I don't understand

I can't, and I can't decide
Wrong, all my  wrong  from right
Day, all my day for night
Dark, all my dark for light
I live, but I love this life
X and why
The land, sea, rivers, trees, the stars, the sky
That and this
We're part of a  bigger  plan don't know what it is
Don't know what it is

You and me
The land, sun, trees, the sky, the stars, the sea
365  degrees  I am a puzzle, you're the  missing  piece
Hang on a minute, just a  minute  please, I'll come

And  everything  under the sun
And  everything  under the sun

What is this  feeling  that I can't explain?
And why am I  never  gonna  sleep  again?
What is this  thing  I've  never  seen before?
A  little  boy lost in a  breaking  storm

Hide and sob and away they fly
So  write  your name in the  summer  sky
Life has  really  only just begun
Life that  comes  and  everything  under the sun

X is why
The land, sea, rivers, trees, the stars, the sky
365 degrees, all of the  surface  and the underneath
Searching your  mellow  and  outsings  your key, ah

And  everything  under the sun
And  everything  under the sun

What is this  feeling  that I can't explain?
And why am I  never  gonna  sleep  again?
What is this  thing  I've  never  seen before?
A  little  boy lost in a  breaking  storm

Hide and sob and away they fly
So  write  your name in the  summer  sky
Life has  really  only just begun
Life that  comes  and  everything  under the sun

And you don't know that you've been born
Can't see the calm  until  the storm
Can't tell your  right  side from your wrong
Can't see the wave you're  riding  on
When I was a  young  boy I  tried  to listen
And I  wanna  feel like that
Little  white  shadows,  blink  and miss them
Part of a  system  I am

If you ever feel like something's missing?
Things you'll  never  understand
Little  white  shadows,  sparkle  and glisten
Part of a  system  plan

All this noise, I'm  waking  up
All the  space  I'm  taking  up
All this  sound  is  breaking  up

Oh

Maybe you get what you wanted
Maybe you  stumbled  upon it
Everything you ever wanted
In a  permanent  state

Maybe you'll know when you see it
Maybe if you say it, you'll mean it
And when you find it, you keep it
In a  permanent  state
A  permanent  state

When I was a  young  boy
I  tried  to listen
Don't you  wanna  feel like that?

We're part of the  human  race and
All of the  stars  and the  outer  space
We're part of the  system  plan

All this noise, I'm  waking  up
And all the space, I'm  taking  up
I said I  cannot  hear you, you're  breaking  up

Oh

Maybe you get what you wanted
Maybe you  stumbled  upon it
Everything you ever wanted
In a  permanent  state

Maybe you'll know when you see it
Maybe if you say it, you'll mean it
And when you find it, you keep it
In a  permanent  state
A  permanent  state

Swim out on a sea of faces,
The tide of the  human  races,
An  answer  now is what I need.

See it in a new sun rising
See it  break  on your horizon
Oh, come on love, stay with me
How long  before  I get in?
Before it starts,  before  I begin?
How long  before  you decide?
Before I know what it  feels  like?
Where To,  where  do I go?
If you  never  try, then you'll  never  know
How long do I have to climb,
Up on the side of this  mountain  of mine?

Look up, I look up at night
Planets are  moving  at the  speed  of light
Climb up, up in the trees
Every  chance  that you get
Is a  chance  you seize
How long am I  gonna  stand
With my head  stuck  under the sand?
I'll  start  before I can stop
Before I see  things  the  right  way up

All that noise, and all that sound
All  those  places I have found
And  birds  go  flying  at the  speed  of sound
To show you how it all began
Birds came  flying  from the underground
If you  could  see it then you'd understand?

Ideas that you'll  never  find
All the  inventors  could  never  design
The  buildings  that you put up
Japan and  China  all lit up
The sign that I couldn't read
Or a  light  that I couldn't see
Some  things  you have to believe
But  others  are puzzles,  puzzling  me

All that noise, and all that sound
All  those  places I have found
And  birds  go  flying  at the  speed  of sound
To show you how it all began
Birds came  flying  from the underground
If you  could  see it then you'd understand
Ah when you see it then you'll understand?

All  those  signs, I knew what they meant
Some  things  you can invent
Some get made, and some get sent
Oh
Birds go  flying  at the  speed  of sound
To show you how it all began
Birds came  flying  from the underground
If you  could  see it then you'd understand
Ah, when you see it then you'll understand?
If you're lost and feel alone
Circumnavigate the globe
All you ever have to hope for two

And the way you seem to float
Circumnavigate in hope
And they seem to lose control
With you

Everyone of us is hurt
And  everyone  of us is scarred
Everyone of us is scared
Not you

But when your eyes're closed
Your head hurts
Your eyes feel so low

Everyone of us is scared
Everyone of us is hurt
Everyone of us has hope

For you
For you
For you

For you
For you
For you
For you
For you
For you
For you
Are you  missing  something?
Looking for something?
Tired of everything
Searching and struggling
Are you  worried  about it?
Do you  wanna  talk  about  it?
Oh You're  gonna  get it  right  some time

There's so much to be  scared  of
And not much to make  sense  of
Are you  running  in a circle?
You can't be too careful
And you can't  relate  it
'Cause it's complicated
Oh You're  gonna  get it  right  some time
You're  gonna  get it  right  some time

It's how you see the world
How many  times  can you see?
You can't  believe  what you learn

It's how you see the world
Don't you  worry  yourself
Your not  gonna  get hurt

Oh

Is  there  something missing?
There's  nobody  listening
Are you  scared  of what you don't know?
don't  wanna  end up on your own?
You need conversation
And information

Oh

Gonna get it  right  sometimes
You just  wanna  get it  right  sometimes

It's how you see the world
How many  times  have you heard?
You can't  believe  a word

It's how you see the world
Don't you  worry  yourself
'Cause  nobody  can learn

Oh
Oh
Oh

That's how you see the world
That's how you see the world
To my surprise, and my delight
I saw sunrise, I saw sunlight
I am  nothing  in the dark
And the  clouds  burst to show  daylight  

Ooh and the sun will shine
Yeah on this  heart  of mine
Ooh and I realize
Who  cannot  live without
Ooh come  apart  without
It

On a hilltop, on a sky-rise
Like a  firstborn  child
And at full tilt, and in full flight
Defeat darkness,  breaking  daylight

Ooh and the sun will shine
Yeah on this  heart  of mine
Ooh and I realized
Who  cannot  live without
Ooh and come  apart  without
Daylight

[Repeat: x10]
Slowly  breaking  through daylight
Slowly  breaking  through daylight
Slowly  breaking  through daylight
Slowly  breaking  through daylight
Bones  sinking  like  stones  
All that we've  fought  for 
Homes,  places  we've  grown  
All of us are done for 

We live in a  beautiful  world 
Yeah we do 
Yeah we do 
We live in a  beautiful  world 

Bones  sinking  like  stones  
All that we've  fought  for 
Homes,  places  we've  grown  
All of us are done for 

We live in a  beautiful  world 
Yeah we do 
Yeah we do 
We live in a  beautiful  world 

We live in a  beautiful  world 
Yeah we do 
Yeah we do 
We live in a  beautiful  world 

Oh all that I know 
There's  nothing  here to run from 
'Cause here
Everybody here's got  somebody  to lean on
Now I  never  meant
To do you wrong
That's what I came here to say

But if I was wrong
Then I'm sorry
I don't let it  stand  in our way

As my head just aches
When I  think  of
The  things  that I shouldn't have done

But, life is for living
We all know
And I don't want to live it alone

Sing
Ah, ah, oh
Sing
Ah, ah, oh,
And just think
Ah, ah, oh

'Cause in the end
There's only us
And oh my friend
There's only love

And in the cave
They're  timing  us
'Cause in the end
There's only love
Pour me, floatin' out to see
An  opportunity  that went by
Pour you, now what you  gonna  do?
Now what you  gonna  do? You just cry

Pour me, so  blind  I couldn't see
The  flowers  for the trees, I don't know why
Pour you, you  split  yourself in two
Now what you  gonna  do? You just cry

I hear you come nearer
I hear you but I don't understand
I hear you come nearer
I hear you but I don't understand

Pour me, floatin' out to see
An  opportunity  that went by
Pour you, now what you  gonna  do?
What you  gonna  do? You just cry

I hear you come nearer
I hear you but I don't understand
I hear you come nearer
I hear you but I don't understand

I don't understand
I don't understand

For feel ?
Strong at alley, I'm  gonna  feel it now
I'm  gonna  feel it now, sing, say, say
You only live twice
Oh, so it seems
One life for yourself
And one for your dreams

You  drift  through the years
And life  seems  stray
Till one  dream  appears
And love is its way

I'd love you to strangers
Ooh,  beckon  you on
Don't  think  of the danger
For a  stranger  is gone

This  dream  is for you
So pay the price
Make one  dream  come true
You only live twice

This  dream  is for you
So pay the price
Make one  dream  come true
You only live twice
You only live twice
Was a long and dark December
From the  rooftops  I remember
There was snow
White snow

Clearly I remember
From the  windows  they were watching
While we  froze  down below

When the future's architecture
By a  carnival  of  idiots  on show
You'd  better  lie low

If you love me
Won't you let me know?

Was a long and dark December
When the  banks  became cathedrals
And the fog
Became God

Priests  clutched  onto bibles
Hollowed out to fit  their  rifles
And the  cross  was held aloft

Bury me in armor
When I'm dead and hit the ground
My  nerves  are  poles  that unfroze

If you love me
Won't you let me know?

I don't want to be a soldier
Who the  captain  of some  sinking  ship
Would stow 
Far below

So if you love me
Why'd you let me go?

I took my love down to  violet  hill
There we sat in snow
All the time she was  silent  and still

So if you love me
Won't you let me know?

If you love me
Won't you let me know?
Scared of  losing  all the time
He  wrote  it in a letter
He was a  friend  of mine
He  heard  you  could  see your future
Inside a  glass  of water
With  ripples  and the rhymes
He  asked  will I see  heaven  in mine?

Oh that is just the way it was
And  nothing  could be better
And  nothing  ever was
And they say you can see your future
Inside a  glass  of water
With  riddles  and the rhymes
But will I see  heaven  in mine?
Oh, oh, oh

Son, don't ask,
Neither how full nor  empty  is your glass
Cling to the mast
Spend your  whole  life  living  in the past
Going  nowhere  fast

So he  wrote  it on a wall
The  hollowest  of halos
Is no halo at all
And  Televisions  selling  plastic  figurines of leaders
Saying  nothing  at all
And you chime
Stars in  heaven  align
Oh

Son, don't ask,
Neither how full nor  empty  is your glass
Cling to the mast
Spend your  whole  life  living  in the past
Going  nowhere  fast

What are we  drinking  when we're done, just  glasses  of water
There's a wild wind blowing
Down the  corner  of my street
Every  night  there, the  headlights  are glowing
There's a cold war coming
On the  radio  I heard
Baby, it's a  violent  world

Oh, love, don't let me go
Won't you take me  where  the  street  lights glow
I can hear it coming
I can hear the  silent  sound
Now my feet won't  touch  the ground

Time came a creeping
Oh and time's a  loaded  gun
(Every road is a ray of light)
It goes on
Time only can lead you on,  still  it's
Such a  beautiful  night

Oh, love, don't let me go
Won't you take me  where  the  street  lights glow
I can hear it coming
Like a  serenade  of sound
Now my feet won't  touch  the ground

Ooouuh ooouuuh

Gravity,  release  me
And don't ever hold me down
Now my feet won't  touch  the ground
Just  because  I'm losing
Doesn't mean I'm lost!
Doesn't mean I'll stop
Doesn't mean I will cross

Just  because  I'm hurting
Doesn't mean I'm hurt
Doesn't mean
I don't get what I deserved
No  better  and no worse

I just got lost
Every river
That I  tried  to cross
Every door
I ever  tried  was locked
Oh and I'm just waiting
'til the  shine  wears off

You  might  be a big fish
In a  little  pond
Doesn't mean you've won
'Cause a long may come
A  bigger  one

And you'll be lost
Every river
That you  tried  to cross
Every gun
You ever held went off
Oh and I'm just waiting
Until the  firing  stopped
Oh and I'm just waiting
'til the  shine  wears off

Aha, I gotcha, uh,
With the same sword
They  knight  you,
They gon' good  night  you with
Shit,
That's only half
If they like you
That ain't even the half
What they  might  do
Don't  believe  me, ask Michael
See Martin, see Malcolm
See Biggie, see Pac,
See  success  and its outcome
See Jesus, see Judas
See Caesar, see Brutus,
See  success  is like suicide
Suicide, it's a suicide
If you succeed,
Prepare to be crucified
Media meddles,
Niggas sue you, you settle
Every step you take,
They  remind  you
You're ghetto
So it's tough
Being  Bobby  Brown
To be  Bobby  then,
You have to be  Bobby  now
And the  question  is,
'Is to have had and lost
Better
Than not  having  at all?'
Because I'm

Oh and I, just waiting
'til the  shine  wears off
Oh and I, just waiting
'til the  shine  wears off
Lovers keep on the road your on
Runners  until  the race is run
Soldiers you've got to  soldier  on
Sometimes even  right  is wrong

They are  turning  my head out
To see what I'm all about
Keeping my head down
To see what it  feels  like now
But I have no doubt
One day, were  gonna  get out

Tonight,  maybe  we're  gonna  run
Dreamin' of the  Osaka  sun
Ohh, ohh, ohhh
Dreamin' of when the  morning  comes

They are  turning  my head out
To see what I'm all about
Keeping my head down
To see what it  feels  like now
But I have no doubt
One day, the sun will come out

Reign of love
I can't let go
To the sea I offer
This  heavy  load

Locusts will
Lift me up
I'm just a prisoner
In a  reign  of love

Locusts will
Let us stop
I wish I'd spoken
To the  reign  of love

Reign of love
By the church, we?re waiting
Reign of love
My  knees  go praying

How I wish
I'd  spoken  up
Or we'd be carried
In the  reign  of love
Let me go boys, let me go
Push my bone from the  highest  cliff to the sea below
Rocks are  waiting  boys,  rocks  are waiting
Swoop down from the sky and  catch  me like the bird to prey

Now my feet won't  touch  the ground
Now my head won't stop
You wait a  lifetime  to be found
Now my feet won't  touch  the ground

Singing now my feet won't  touch  the ground
Now my head won't stop
You wait a  lifetime  to be found
Now my feet won't  touch  the ground

Now my feet won't  touch  the ground
Smoke is  rising  from the houses
People  Burying  their dead
I ask  somebody  what the time is
But time doesn't  matter  to them yet

People  talking  without speaking
Trying to take what they can get
I ask you if you remember
Propekt, how  could  I forget?

Drums
Here it comes
Don't you wish that life  could  be as simple,
As fish  swimming  round in a barrel.
When you've got the gun?

Oh and I'll run
Here it comes
We're just two  little  figures in a soup bowl
Trying to get the  anaconda  control
When I wasn't one

Here I lie
On my own in a  separate  sky
Here I lie
On my own in a  separate  sky
I don't want to die
On my own, here, tonight
Here I lie
On my own in a  separate  sky
Then  there  was rain
The sky wore a veil of gold and gray
At  night  it was the  bright  of the moon with me
Time was just floating

Then  there  was rain
This town's  foundations  are crumbling
To the  ground  comes a bit of a tumbling
And time just  floated  away
We can  watch  it and stay and we can listen

Oh,  rainy  day, come round
Sometimes I just want it to slow down
And we're  separated  now
I'm down
But I love it when you come over to the house
I love it when you come over to my house

Then  there  was rain
And I  spent  the  night  with the  Queen  of Spain
My  lonely  little  heart  would've  broke  again
Times were vicious

Singing,  deeper  that the  knife  goes in the more you win
You win but with less than when you begin
Deeper that the  knife  goes in
Oooooooooooooooh

Ooh,  rainy  day come round
Sometimes I just want it to slow down
We're  separated  now
I'm down
But I love it when you come over to the house
I love it when you come over to my house

Aaaaah  aaaah  aaaaaah
Aaaaah  aaaah  aaaaaah
Aaaaah  aaaah  aaaaaah

But I love it when you come over to the house
I love it when you come over to my house
But I love it when you come over to the house
I love it when you come over to my house
And in the end
We lie awake
And we dream
We'll make an escape

And in the end
We lie awake
And we dream
We'll make an escape

Ooh?
I used to rule the world
Seas  would  rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning, I  sleep  alone
Sweep the  streets  I used to own

I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the  crowd  would sing
Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!

One  minute  I held the key
Next the  walls  were  closed  on me
And I  discovered  that my  castles  stand
Upon  pillars  of salt and  pillars  of sand

I hear  Jerusalem  bells are ringing
Roman  Cavalry  choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my  sword  and shield
My  missionaries  in a  foreign  field
For some  reason  I can't explain
Once you go  there  was never,  never  a  honest  word
And that was when I  ruled  the world

It was a  wicked  and wild wind
Blew down the  doors  to let me in
Shattered  windows  and the  sound  of drums
People couldn't  believe  what I'd become

Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a  silver  plate
Just a  puppet  on a  lonely  string
Oh who  would  ever want to be king?

I hear  Jerusalem  bells are ringing
Roman  Calvary  choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my  sword  and shield
My  missionaries  in a  foreign  field
For some  reason  I can't explain
I know  Saint  Peter won't call my name
Never rule this world
But that was when I  ruled  the world

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

I hear  Jerusalem  bells are ringing
Roman  Calvary  choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my  sword  and shield
My  missionaries  in a  foreign  field
For some  reason  I can't explain
I know  Saint  Peter won't call my name
Never rule this world
But that was when I  ruled  the world
There's a wild wind blowing,
Down the  corner  of my street
Every  night  there the  headlights  are glowing

there's a cold war coming,
On the  radio  I heard
Baby it's a  violent  world

Oh love don't let me go
Won't you take me  where  the  streetlights  glow
I  could  hear it coming
I  could  hear the  sirens  sound
Now my feet won't  touch  the ground

Time came a-creepin'
Oh and time's a  loaded  gun
Every road is a ray of light
It goes o-o-on
Time only can lead you on
Still it's such a  beautiful  night

Oh love don't let me go
Won't you take me  where  the  streetlights  glow
I  could  hear it coming
Like a  serenade  of sound
Now my feet won't  touch  the ground

Gravity  release  me,
And don't ever hold me down
Now my feet won't  touch  the ground.
Those who are dead, are not dead
They're just  living  in my head
And  since  I fell for that spell
I am  living  there as well
Oh,

Time is so  short  and I'm sure
There must be  something  more

Those who are dead, are not dead
They're just  living  in my head, oh
And  since  I fell for that spell
I am  living  there as well, oh

Time is so  short  and I'm sure
There must be  something  more.

You  thought  you  might  be a ghost
You  thought  you  might  be a ghost
You didn't get to  heaven  but you made it close
You didn't get to  heaven  but you made it close

You  thought  you  might  be a ghost
You  thought  you  might  be a ghost
You didn't get to  heaven  but you made it close
You didn't get to  heaven  but you oh, oh,

Oh, oh,

Those who are dead are not dead
They're just  living  in my head
Oh
At  night  they  would  go  walking  'till the  breaking  of the day
The  morning  is for sleeping
Through the dark streets, they go searching, to see God in  their  own way
Save the  nighttime  for your weeping
Your weeping

Singing la  lalalalala  la la
And the  night  over  London  lay

So we rode down to the river,  where  the  toiling  ghosts spring
For  their  curses to be broken
We'd go  underneath  the arches,  where  the  witches  are in the saying
There are  ghost  towns in the ocean
The ocean

Singing la  lalalalala  la la
And the  night  over  London  lay

God is in the  houses  and God is in my head
And all the  cemeteries  in London
I see God come in my garden, but I don't know what he said
For my  heart  it wasn't open
Not open

Singing la  lalalalala  la la
And the  night  over  London  lay
Singing la  lalalalala  la la
There's no  light  over  London  today.
All  winter  we got  carried  away
Over on the rooftops, let's get married
All  summer  we just hurried
So come over, just be patient, and don't worry
So come over, just be patient, and don't worry

So come over, just be patient, and don't worry
And don't worry

Try
Try
Try
Try

No, I don't want to  battle  from  beginning  to end
I don't want a  cycle  of  recycled  revenge
I don't want to  follow  Death and all of his friends

No, I don't want to  battle  from  beginning  to end
I don't want a  cycle  of  recycled  revenge
I don't want to  follow  Death and all of his friends

And, in the end, we lie awake, and we  dream  of  making  our escape
And, in the end, we lie awake, and we  dream  of  making  our escape
Just  because  I'm losing
Doesn't mean I'm lost
Doesn't mean I'll stop
Doesn't mean I will cross

Just  because  I'm hurting
Doesn't mean I'm hurt
Doesn't mean I didn't get what I deserve
No  better  and no worse

I just got lost
Every  river  that I've  tried  to cross
And  every  door I ever  tried  was locked
Oh, and I'm just  waiting  'till the  shine  wears off

You  might  be a big fish
In a  little  pond
Doesn't mean you've won
'Cause  along  may come
A  bigger  one
And you'll be lost

Every  river  that you  tried  to cross
Every gun you ever held went off
Oh, and I'm just  waiting  'till the  firing  starts
Oh, and I'm just  waiting  'till the  shine  wears off
Oh, and I'm just  waiting  'till the  shine  wears off

Oh, and I'm just  waiting  'till the  shine  wears off
Oh, and I'm just  waiting  'till the  shine  wears off
Lovers, keep on the road you're on
Runners,  until  the race is run
Soldiers, you've got to  soldier  on
Sometimes even the  right  is wrong

They are  turning  my head out
To see what I'm all about
Keeping my head down
To see what it  feels  like now
But I have no doubt
One day, we're  gonna  get out

Tonight  maybe  we're  gonna  run
Dreaming of the  Osaka  sun
Oh, oh,
Dreaming of when the  morning  comes

They are  turning  my head out
To see what I'm all about
Keeping my head down
To see what it  feels  like now
But I have no doubt
One day the sun will come out

Oh,

Reign of love
I can't let it go
To the sea I offer
This  heavy  load

Locusts will
Lift me up
I'm just a prisoner
In a  reign  of love

Locusts will
Let us stop
I wish I'd spoken
To the  reign  of love

Reign of love
By the church, we're waiting
Reign of love
My  knees  go praying

How I wish
I'd  spoken  up
Or we'd be carried
On the  reign  of love
They were sitting
They were  talking  in the  strawberry  swing
Every  moment  was so precious

They were sitting
They were  talking  in the  strawberry  swing
Everybody was for fighting
Wouldn't  wanna  waste a thing

Cold, cold water
Bring me round
Now my feet won't  touch  the ground
Cold, cold water
What ya say?
It's such
It's such a  perfect  day
It's such a  perfect  day

I remember
We were  walking  up to  strawberry  swing
I can't wait 'til the morning
Wouldn't  wanna  change a thing

People  moving  all the time
Inside a  perfectly  straight line
Don't you  wanna  curve away
It's such
It's such a  perfect  day
It's such a  perfect  day

Now the sky  could  be blue
I don't mind
Without you it's a  waste  of time
Could be blue

I don't mind
Without you it's a  waste  of time
Could be blue,
Could be grey
Without you I'm just  miles  away

Could be blue
I don't mind
Without you it's a  waste  of time.
Was a long and dark December
From the  rooftops  I remember
There was snow
White snow

Clearly I remember
From the  windows  they were watching
While we  froze  down below

When the future's architecture
By a  carnival  of  idiots  on show
You'd  better  lie low

If you love me
Won't you let me know?

Was a long and dark December
When the  banks  became cathedrals
And the fog
Became God

Priests  clutched  onto bibles
Hollowed out to fit  their  rifles
And the  cross  was held aloft

Bury me in armor
When I'm dead and hit the ground
My  nerves  are  poles  that unfroze

If you love me
Won't you let me know?

I don't want to be a soldier
Who the  captain  of some  sinking  ship
Would stow 
Far below

So if you love me
Why'd you let me go?

I took my love down to  violet  hill
There we sat in snow
All the time she was  silent  and still

So if you love me
Won't you let me know?

If you love me
Won't you let me know?
I used to rule the world
Seas  would  rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning, I  sleep  alone
Sweep the  streets  I used to own

I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the  crowd  would sing
Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!

One  minute  I held the key
Next the  walls  were  closed  on me
And I  discovered  that my  castles  stand
Upon  pillars  of salt and  pillars  of sand

I hear  Jerusalem  bells are ringing
Roman  Cavalry  choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my  sword  and shield
My  missionaries  in a  foreign  field
For some  reason  I can't explain
Once you go  there  was never,  never  a  honest  word
And that was when I  ruled  the world

It was a  wicked  and wild wind
Blew down the  doors  to let me in
Shattered  windows  and the  sound  of drums
People couldn't  believe  what I'd become

Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a  silver  plate
Just a  puppet  on a  lonely  string
Oh, who  would  ever want to be king?

I hear  Jerusalem  bells are ringing
Roman  Calvary  choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my  sword  and shield
My  missionaries  in a  foreign  field
For some  reason  I can't explain
I know  Saint  Peter won't call my name
Never an  honest  word
But that was when I  ruled  the world

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

I hear  Jerusalem  bells are ringing
Roman  Calvary  choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my  sword  and shield
My  missionaries  in a  foreign  field
For some  reason  I can't explain
I know  Saint  Peter won't call my name
Never an  honest  word
But that was when I  ruled  the world
When it  started  we had high hopes
Now my back's on the line
My back's on the ropes
When it  started  we were alright
But  night  makes a fool of us in daylight

Yeah we were  dying  of frustration
Saying "Lord lead me not into temptation"
But it's not easy when she  turns  you on
Since they gone

If you'll only, if you'd only say yes
Whether you will's anybody's guess
God only, God  knows  I'm  trying  my best
But I'm just so  tired  of this loneliness

So, up they  picked  me by the big toe
I was held from the rooftop, then they let go
There's only screaming
Let the windows, down
As I  crawl  to the ground

If you'll only, if you'd only say yes
Whether you will's anybody's guess
God, only God  knows  she won't let me rest
But I'm just so  tired  of this loneliness
I've  become  so  tired  of this loneliness.
How long  before  I get in?
Before it starts,  before  I begin? 
How long  before  you decide? 
Before I know what it  feels  like? 
Where To,  where  do I go?
If you  never  try, then you'll  never  know
How long do I have to climb,
Up on the side of this  mountain  of mine? 

Look up, I look up at night
Planets are  moving  at the  speed  of light
Climb up, up in the  trees  
Every  chance  that you get
Is a  chance  you seize
How long am I  gonna  stand
With my head  stuck  under the sand? 
I'll  start  before I can stop
Before I see  things  the  right  way up

All that noise, and all that sound
All  those  places I have found
And  birds  go  flying  at the  speed  of sound
To show you how it all  began  
Birds came  flying  from the underground
If you  could  see it then you'd understand? 

Ideas that you'll  never  find
All the  inventors  could  never  design
The  buildings  that you put up
Japan and  China  all lit up
The sign that I couldn't read 
Or a  light  that I couldn't see
Some  things  you have to  believe  
But  others  are puzzles,  puzzling  me

All that noise, and all that sound
All  those  places I have found
And  birds  go  flying  at the  speed  of sound
To show you how it all began
Birds came  flying  from the  underground  
If you  could  see it then you'd  understand  
Ah when you see it then you'll understand?

All  those  signs, I knew what they meant
Some  things  you can invent
Some get made, and some get sent
Oh 
Birds go  flying  at the  speed  of sound
To show you how it all began
Birds came  flying  from the underground
If you  could  see it then you'd understand
Ah, when you see it then you'll understand?

My song is love
Love to the loveless, shown
And it goes up
You don't have to be alone

Your  heavy  heart
Is made of stone
And its so hard to see you clearly
You don't have to be on your own
You don't have to be on your own

And I'm not  gonna  take it back
Well I'm not  gonna  say I don't mean that
Your the  target  that I'm  aiming  at
And I get that  message  home

My song is love
My song is love, unknown
And I'm on fire for you, clearly
You don't have to be alone
You don't have to be on your own

And I'm not  gonna  take it back
And I'm not  gonna  say I don't mean that
Your the  target  that I'm  aiming  at
But I'm  nothing  on my own
Got to get that  message  home

And I'm not  gonna  stand and wait
Not  gonna  leave it  until  its much too late
On a  platform  I'm  gonna  stand and say
That I'm  nothing  on my own
And I love you,  please  come home

My song is love, is love unknown
And I've got to get that  message  home
I turn the  music  up, I got my  records  on
I shut the  world  outside  until  the  lights  come on
Maybe the  streets  alight,  maybe  the  trees  are gone
I feel my  heart  start  beating  to my  favourite  song

And all the kids they dance, all the kids all night
Until  Monday  morning  feels  another life
I turn the  music  up
I'm on a roll this time
And  heaven  is in sight

I turn the  music  up, I got my  records  on
From  underneath  the  rubble  sing a  rebel  song
Don't want to see  another  generation drop
I'd  rather  be a  comma  than a full stop

Maybe I'm in the black,  maybe  I'm on my knees
Maybe I'm in the gap  between  the two trapezes
But my  heart  is  beating  and my  pulses  start
Cathedrals in my heart

As we saw oh this  light  I  swear  you,  emerge  blinking into
To tell me it's alright
As we soar walls,  every  siren is a symphony
And  every  tear's a waterfall
Is a waterfall
Oh
Is a waterfall
Oh oh oh
Is a is a waterfall
Every tear
Is a waterfall
Oh oh oh

So you can hurt, hurt me bad
But  still  I'll  raise  the flag

Oh
It was a wa wa wa wa wa-aterfall
A wa wa wa wa wa-aterfall

Every tear
Every tear
Every  teardrop  is a waterfall

Every tear
Every tear
Every  teardrop  is a waterfall

Every tear
Every tear
Every  teardrop  is a waterfall
Somewhere up  above  the stars
The  wreckage  of a  universe  floats past
Somewhere up  above  my heart
A tiny  little  seed is sown
A  government  is overthrown
Who  knows  when we'll be  coming  home at last

And I  heard  it on the radio
That one day we'll be  living  in the stars
And I  heard  it on a tv show
That  somewhere  up above
And in my heart
They'll be  tearing  us apart
Maybe  moving  us to mars

We won't see the  earth  again
In  these  seconds just  remain  unchanged

Eight to nine, nine to ten
We are  meeting  for the  first  time
We  might  never meet  again  you and me
We are  meeting  for the  first  time
Can't you see
Seven, six, five, four, three
We are  meeting  for the  first  time
Singing this  space  symphony

They'll be  tearing  us  apart  moving us to mars
Past the  satellites  and stars
They'll be  moving  us to mars
They got one eye  watching  you
One eye on what you do
So be  careful  who it is you're  talking  to
They got one eye  watching  you
One eye on what you do
So be  careful  what it is you're  trying  to do

And be  careful  when you're  walking  in the view
Just be  careful  when you're  walking  in the view

Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Got one eye on the road and one on you
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Got one eye on the road and one on

They got one eye  watching  you
And one eye on what you do
So be  careful  'cause  nothing  they say is true
D-don't  believe  a word, it's us  against  the world
And we just got to turn up to be heard

Hear the  crocodiles  ticking 'round the world
Hear  those  crocodiles ticking, they go  ticking  'round the world

Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Got one eye on the road and one on you
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Got one eye on the road and
You  could  hear them  climbing  the stairs
I got my  right  side  fighting  while
My left  hides  under the chairs

Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Got one eye on the road and one on you
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Got one eye on the road and one on you
Stole a key
Took a car  downtown  where the lost boys meet
Took a car  downtown  and took what they  offered  me
To set me free

I saw the  lights  go down at the end of the scene
I saw the  lights  go down and  standing  in  front  of me

In my  scarecrow  dreams
When they  smashed  my  heart  into smithereens
Be a  bright  red rose come  bursting  the concrete
Be a  cartoon  heart

Light a fire, a fire, a spark
Light a fire, a  flame  in my heart

We'll run riot
We'll be  glowing  in the dark ooh ooh ooh
We'll be  glowing  in the dark ooh ooh ah

All the boys, all the girls
All that  matters  in the world
All the boys, all the girls
All that  matters  that occurs
All the highs, all the lows
As the room is spinning, oh

We'll run riot
We'll be  glowing  in the dark

So we’ll soar
Luminous and wired
We’ll be  glowing  in the dark
And if I lost the map
If I lost it all
Or fell into the trap
Then she'd call
'When you're  tired  of racing
And you find you  never  left the start
Come on baby
Don't let it  break  your heart'

Though  heavily  we bled
Still on we crawl
Try to  catch  a cannonball
And a  slowly  burning tide, oh
Through my  veins  is flowing
From my  shipwreck  I  heard  her call

She said 'When you're  tired  of  aiming  your arrows
Still you  never  hit the mark, oh
Even in your  rains  and shadows
Still we're  never  going to part
Come on baby
Don't let it  break  your heart, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Don't let it  break  your heart, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Don't let it  break  your heart

Don't let it  break  your heart
Written in  graffiti  on a  bridge  in a park
Do you ever get the feeling
That you're  missing  the mark?
It's so cold, it's so cold
It's so cold, it's so cold

Written up in  marker  on a  factory  sign
I  struggle  with the feeling
That my life isn't mine
It's so cold, it's so cold
It's so cold, it's so cold

See the  arrow  that they shot trying
To tear us  apart  took the fire from my  belly  and
The beat from my heart
Still I won't let go
Still I won't let go

You, ooh, ooh
Oh you, use your  heart  as a weapon
And it  hurts  like heaven

On  every  street,  every  car,  every  surface in nature
And at the  streets  are  rising  and you'd  rather  sing
Don't let them take control
No, we won't let 'em take control

Yes, I feel a  little  bit nervous
Yes, I feel  nervous  and I  cannot  relax
I'm  coming  'round to get us
I'm  coming  'round when they don't know the facts

So on a  concrete  canvas and a glow in the dark
On a  concrete  canvas, I will make you a mark
Armed with the  spray  can soul
Let me out with the  spray  can soul

You, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

'Cause you use your  heart  as a weapon
And it  hurts  like heaven

Whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh

Yeah, it's true, when you
Use your  heart  as a weapon
And it  hurts  like heaven

Oh and it  hurts  like heaven
When she was just a girl she  expected  the world
But it flew away from her reach
So she ran away in her  sleep  and  dreamed  of
Para-para-paradise, para-para-paradise, para-para-paradise
Every time she  closed  her eyes

When she was just a girl she  expected  the world
But it flew away from her  reach  and the  bullets  catch in her teeth
Life goes on, it gets so heavy
The  wheel  breaks the  butterfly  every tear a waterfall
In the  night  the  stormy  night she'll  close  her eyes
In the  night  the  stormy  night away she'd fly

And  dream  of para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise

(Oh oh oh oh oh, oh-oh-oh)

She'd  dream  of para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise

(Oh oh oh oh oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)

La-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
And so  lying  underneath  those  stormy skies
She'd say, "oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I know the sun must set to rise"

This  could  be para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise

This  could  be para-para-paradise
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

This  could  be para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise

This  could  be para-para-paradise
Oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh, oh

This  could  be para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise

This  could  be para-para-paradise
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Once upon a time  somebody  ran
Somebody ran away saying, "Fast as they can"
I got to go
I got to go

Once upon a time we fell apart
You're  holding  in your hands
The two  halves  of my heart
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

Once upon a time we're  burning  bright
That all we ever  seemed  to do is fight
On and on
And on and on and on

Once upon a time on the same side
Once upon a time on the same side
In the same game, now why'd you have to go
Have to go and  throw  it all in my flame

Could've been a princess, you'd be a king
Could have had a  castle  and worn a ring
But no, you let me go

I could've been a princess, you'd be a king
Could have had a  castle  and worn a ring,
But no, you let me go

Stole my star
La-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la
You  stole  my star
La-la-la-la-la-la

'Cause you  really  hurt me
Oh you  really  hurt me
'Cause you  really  hurt me
Oh you  really  hurt me
'Cause you  really  hurt me
Oh-oh, you  really  hurt me
'Cause you  really  hurt me
You  really  hurt me
Lord I don't know  which  way I am going
Which way, the  river  gonna flow
It's just  seems  that upstream, I keep rolling
Still got such a long way to go
Still got such a long way to go

Then at last, it's your right, I know, I swear
We'll find  somewhere  the  streets  are  paved  with gold
But it's fly,  split  the sky
But that's all right, sometimes
The  sunlight  comes  streaming  through the holes
So it's over,
This time I know it's gone
Salt  water  tasted it too long
I only know I'm wrong
Now I know it's gone

Up in flames, up in flames
Up in  flames  we have  slowly  gone

So it's over,
This time you're  flying  on
This time I know no song
Can stop it  slowly  burn
Can stop it  slowly  gone

Up in flames, up in flames
Up in  flames  we have  slowly  gone

Up in flames, up in flames
Up in  flames  we have  slowly  gone
Oh, we have  slowly  gone
Can we pour some  water  on?
The  birds  they sang, at  break  of day
Start  again  I hear them say
It's so hard to just walk away

The  birds  they sang, all a choir
Start  again  a  little  higher
It's a  spark  in a sea of gray

The sky is blue  dream  that lie 'till it's true
Then  taken  back the  punch  I threw
My arms turn in oh,  those  clumsy things
Send me up to that  wonderful  world
And then I'm up with the birds

Might have to go
Where they don't know my name
Float all over the world
Just to see her again
And I won't show or feel any pain
Even  though  all my  armor  might rust in the rain

A  simple  plot
But I know one day
Good  things  are  coming  our way

A  simple  plot
But I know one day
Good  things  are  coming  our way

Oh, yeah
Oh  morning  come bursting, the  clouds  amen
Lift off this blindfold, let me see again
Bring back the water, let your  ships  roll in
In my  heart  she left a hole

The  tightrope  that I'm  walking  just  sways  and ties
The  devil  as he's  talking  with  those  angel's eyes
And I just want to be  there  when the  lightning  strikes
And the  saints  go  marching  in

And sing slow it down
Through  chaos  as it swirls
It's us  against  the world

Like a  river  to a raindrop, I lost a friend
My  drunken  as a  Daniel  in a lion's den
And  tonight  I know it all has to  begin  again
So  whatever  you do, don't let go

And if we  could  float away
Fly up to the  surface  and just  start  again
And lift off  before  trouble
Just  erodes  us in the rain

Just  erodes  us in the rain
Just  erodes  us and see roses
In the rain

Sing slow it down
Slow it down

Through  chaos  as it swirls
It's us  against  the world
Through  chaos  as it swirls
It's us  against  the world
I turn the  music  up, I got my  records  on
I shut the  world  outside  until  the  lights  come on

I feel my  heart  start  beating  to my  favourite  song

And all the kids they dance, all the kids all night
Until  Monday  morning  feels  another life
I turn the  music  up
I'm on a roll this time
And  heaven  is in sight

I turn the  music  up, I got my  records  on
From  underneath  the  rubble  sing a  rebel  song
Don't want to see  another  generation drop
I'd  rather  be a  comma  than a full stop

Maybe I'm in the black,  maybe  I'm on my knees
Maybe I'm in the gap  between  the two trapezes
But my  heart  is  beating  and my  pulses  start
Cathedrals in my heart

As we saw oh this  light  I  swear  you,  emerge  blinking into
To tell me it's alright
As we soar walls,  every  siren is a symphony
And  every  tear's a waterfall
Is a waterfall
Oh
Is a waterfall
Oh oh oh
Is a is a waterfall
Every tear
Is a waterfall
Oh oh oh

So you can hurt, hurt me bad
But  still  I'll  raise  the flag

Oh
It was a wa wa wa wa wa-aterfall
A wa wa wa wa wa-aterfall

Every tear
Every tear
Every  teardrop  is a waterfall

Every tear
Every tear
Every  teardrop  is a waterfall

Every tear
Every tear
Every  teardrop  is a waterfall
Sunlight,  opened  up my eyes
To see for the  first  time
It  opened  them up
And tonight,  rivers  will run dry
But not for the  first  time
Rivers will run

Hundreds of  years  in the future
There  could  be computers
Looking for life on Earth
Don't  fight  for the  wrong  side
Say what you feel like
Say how you feel

You'll go backwards, but then
You'll go forwards, again
You'll go backwards, but then
You'll go

Created, then  drilled  and invaded
If  somebody  made it
Someone will mess it up
And you are not  wrong  to
Ask who does this  belong  to?
It  belongs  to all of us

You'll go backwards, again
You'll go forwards, again
You'll go backwards, again
You'll go forwards

You'll go backwards, but then
You'll go forwards, again
You'll go backwards, but then
You'll go forwards
When she was just a girl she  expected  the world
But it flew away from her reach
So she ran away in her  sleep  and  dreamed  of
Para-para-paradise, para-para-paradise, para-para-paradise
Every time she  closed  her eyes

When she was just a girl she  expected  the world
But it flew away from her  reach  and the  bullets  catch in her teeth
Life goes on, it gets so heavy
The  wheel  breaks the  butterfly  every tear a waterfall
In the  night  the  stormy  night she'll  close  her eyes
In the  night  the  stormy  night away she'd fly

And  dream  of para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise

(Oh oh oh oh oh, oh-oh-oh)

She'd  dream  of para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise

(Oh oh oh oh oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)

La-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
And so  lying  underneath  those  stormy skies
She'd say, "Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I know the sun must set to rise"

This  could  be para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise

This  could  be para-para-paradise
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

This  could  be para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise

This  could  be para-para-paradise
Oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh, oh

This  could  be para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise

This  could  be para-para-paradise
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
There was a time, I used to look into my father's eyes
In a  happy  home, I was a king I had a  golden  throne
Those days are gone, now ﻿the  memories  are on the wall
I hear the  sounds  from the  places  where I was born

Up on the hill  across  the blue lake
That's  where  I had my  first  heart break
I  still  remember how it all changed
My  father  said
Don't you worry, don't you  worry  child
See heaven's got a plan for you
Don't you worry, don't you  worry  now, yeah

Don't you worry, don't you  worry  child
See heaven's got a plan for you
Don't you worry, don't you  worry  now, yeah

There was a time, I met a girl of a  different  kind
We  ruled  the world,
Thought I'll  never  lose her out of sight
We were so young
I  think  of her now and then
I  still  hear the songs,  reminding  me of a friend

Up on the hill  across  the blue lake
That's  where  I had my  first  heart break
I  still  remember how it all changed
My  father  said
Don't you worry, don't you  worry  child
See heaven's got a plan for you
Don't you worry, don't you  worry  now, yeah

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
See heaven's got a plan for you
Don't you worry, don't you  worry  child
See heaven's got a plan for you
Don't you worry, don't you  worry  now, yeah

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah
Stole a key
Took a car  downtown  where the lost boys meet
Took a car  downtown  and took what they  offered  me
To set me free

I saw the  lights  go down at the end of the scene
I saw the  lights  go down and  standing  in  front  of me

In my  scarecrow  dreams
When they  smashed  my  heart  into smithereens
Be a  bright  red rose come  bursting  the concrete
Be the  cartoon  heart

Light a fire,  light  a spark
Light a fire, a  flame  in my heart

We'll run wild oh
We'll be  glowing  in the dark
We'll be  glowing  in the dark

All the boys, all the girls
All that  matters  in the world
All the boys, all the girls
All that  matters  that occurs
All the highs, all the lows
As the room is spinning, oh

We'll run wild 
We'll be  glowing  in the dark

Living  innocent  wild
We'll be  glowing  in the dark
Some saw the sun
Some saw the smoke
Some  heard  the gun
Some bent the bow

Sometimes the wire 
Must  tense  for the note
Caught in the fire, say oh
We're  about  to explode

Carry your world
I'll  carry  your world
Carry your world
I'll  carry  your world

Some far away
Some  search  for gold
Some  dragon  to slay
Heaven we hope 
Is just up the road
Show me the way, Lord
'Cause I am  about  to explode

Carry your world
I'll  carry  your world
Carry your world
I'll  carry  your world
Carry your  world  (Carry your world)
And all your hurt

Carry your world
Carry your world
On and on
You're told  which  side you're on
You're forced, you're thrown
To  become  side as to cut the corn

Aah
And all your  friends  they
Ride into the sunset
Fly into the sunset
And away they blow

And all your  friends  they
Ride into the sunset
Fly into the sunset
And away they're thrown
Into the fire

Ten below
The call come on the radio
Ahh
Over you go
And the red now all the  rivers  flow
The  poppies  grow

All your  friends  they
Ride into the sunset
Fly into the sunset
And away they're blown

All your  friends  they
Ride into the sunset
Arrive into the sunset
And they're  taken  home

Open fire
Open fire

Open fire
Open fire
Open fire
And fire
Just arrived, the fire
Maybe I'm just a ghost
Disappear when anybody's close
Go  through  you when you travel
Travel over near

Maybe I'm just a ghost
Emptied by 'em,  anybody  knows
Maybe I'm on a rose
Or am I even here?

Yeah! 

Every time I try to walk  through  walls
More  walls  appear
What's the  point  of  feeling  love for you
When you don't  believe  I'm here?
What's the  point  of  trying  to  raise  your voice
If no one ever hears?
Every time I try to pull you close
You disappear

Maybe I'm a ghost
Just a  whisper  in a path of smoke
A  secret  that  nobody  knows
No one will ever hear

Oh,  maybe  I'm a ghost
Specter on a  roller  coast
Fallen out of rose
Something  people  fear

Yeah! 

And  every  time I  thought  I walk  through  walls
It's all  become  clear
What's the  point  of  feeling  love for you
When you don't  believe  I'm here?
What's the  point  saying "Rescue me!"
If no one ever hears?
Every time I try to pull you close
You disappear
Every time I try to pull you close
You disappear

And  every  time I  thought  I walk  through  walls
It's all  become  clear
Every time I try to pull you close
You disappear

Every time I try to pull you close
You disappear
'Cause you're a sky, 'cause you're a sky full of stars
I'm  gonna  give you my heart
'Cause you're a sky, 'cause you're a sky full of stars
'Cause you  light  up the path

I don't care, go on and tear me apart
I don't care if you do, ooh
'Cause in a sky, 'cause in a sky full of stars
I  think  I saw you

'Cause you're a sky, 'cause you're a sky full of stars
I  wanna  die in your arms, ooh
'Cause you get  lighter  the more it gets dark
I'm  gonna  give you my heart

I don't care, go on and tear me apart
And I don't care if you do, ooh
'Cause in a sky, 'cause in a sky full of stars
I  think  I see you
I  think  I see you

'Cause you're a sky, you're a sky full of stars
Such a  heavenly  view
You're such a  heavenly  view
I  think  of you
I haven't slept
I  think  I do
But I don't forget
My body moves
Goes  where  I will
But  though  I try my  heart  stays still
It  never  moves
Just won't be led
And so my  mouth  waters to be fed
And you're  always  in my head
You're  always  in my head
You're  always  in my head
You're  always  in my head

You're  always  in my head
Always in my head
Always in my

This, I guess
Is to tell you you're  chosen  out from the rest
Late  night  watching TV
Used to be you here  beside  me
Used to be your arms  around  me
Your body on my body

When the  world  means  nothing  to me
Another's arms, another's arms
When the pain just rips  right  through me
Another's arms, another's arms

Late  night  watching TV
Used to be you here  beside  me
Is  there  someone  there  to  reach  me?
Or  someone  there to find me

When the pain just rips  right  through me
Another's arms, another's arms
And this's just  torture  to me
Another's arms, another's arms

Pull  yourself  into me
Another's arms, another's arms
Love  means  nothing to me
Another's arms, another's arms

Got to pull you  close  into me
Another's arms, another's arms
Pull  yourself  right  through  me
Another's arms, another's arms

Late  night  watching TV
Wish that you were here  beside  me
Wish that your arms were  around  me
Your body on my body
Got a  tattoo  that said "together  through  life"
Carved in your name with my  poker  knife
And you  wonder  when you wake up, will it be  alright  oh oh
Feels like there's  something  broken inside

All I know
All I know
Is that in lost  whenever  you go
All I know is that I love you so
So much that it hurts

Got a  tattoo  and that  paint  is alright
Just  wanted  a way of  keeping  you  inside  (oh oh oh oh oh)

All I know
All I know
Is that I'm lost
In your fire bellow
All I know is that I love you so
So much that it hurts

I see the road  begin  to climb
I see the stars,  begin  to show
I see your  colors  and I'm  dying  of thirst

All I know is that I love you so
So much that it hurts
Oh yeah yeah yeah
So much that it hurts
So much that it hurts
Call it magic, call it true
I call it  magic  when I'm with you
And I just got broken,  broken  into two
Still I call it magic, when I'm next to you

And I don't, and I don't, and I don't, and I don't
No I don't, it's true
I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't
Want  anybody  else but you

I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't
No I don't, it's true
I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't
Want  anybody  else but you

Ooh ooh ooh

Call it magic, cut me into two
And with all your magic, I  disappear  from view
And I can't get over, can't get over you
Still, I call it magic, such a  precious  truth

And I don't, and I don't, and I don't, and I don't
No I don't, it's true
I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't
Want  anybody  else but you

I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't
No I don't, it's true
I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't
Want  anybody  else but you

Wanna fall, I fall so far
I  wanna  fall, fall so hard
And I call it magic
And I call it true
Call it magic

Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh

And if you were to ask me
After all that we've been through
Still  believe  in magic?
Well yes, I do
Oh yes, I do
Oh yes, I do
Oh yes, I do
Of  course  I do
In the  darkness  before the dawn
In the  swirling  of this storm
When I'm  rolling  with the  punches  and hope is gone
Leave a light, a  light  on

Millions of  miles  from home
In the  swirling  swimming on
When I'm  rolling  with the  thunder  but  bleed  from thorns
Leave a light, a  light  on
Leave a light, a  light  on

Leave a light, a  light  on
Leave a light, a  light  on

In the  darkness  before the dawn
In the  darkness  before the dawn
Leave a light, a  light  on
Leave a light, a  light  on
A  flock  of birds
Hovering above
Just a  flock  of birds
That's how you  think  of love

And I always
Look up to the sky
Pray  before  the dawn
'Cause they fly always
Sometimes they arrive
Sometimes they are gone
They fly on

A  flock  of birds
Hovering above
Into  smoke  I'm turned
And rise  following  them up

Still I always
Look up to the sky
Pray  before  the dawn
'Cause they fly away
One  minute  they arrive,
Next you know they're gone
They fly on
Fly on

So fly on
Ride through
Maybe one day I'll fly next to you

They fly on
Ride through
Maybe one day I come fly with you
Fly on
Fly on
Fly on
Wait for your call, love
The call  never  came
Ready to fall, love
Ready to claim

I'm  ready  for it all, love
I'm  ready  for a pain
Meet  under  sun
Meet me again
In the rain
In the rain
In the rain
The rain

Behind the walls, love
I'm  trying  to change
And I'm  ready  for it all, love
I'm  ready  for a change
Meet  under  blue sky
Meet me again
In the rain
The rain, the rain
In the rain
The rain

Got to find  yourself  alone in this world
You've got to find  yourself  alone
'Cause you're a sky, 'cause you're a sky full of stars
I'm  gonna  give you my heart
'Cause you're a sky, 'cause you're a sky full of stars
'Cause you  light  up the path

I don't care, go on and tear me apart
I don't care if you do, ooh
'Cause in a sky, 'cause in a sky full of stars
I  think  I saw you

I don't care if you do, ooh
'Cause in a sky, 'cause in a sky full of stars
I  think  I see you
I  think  I see you

'Cause you're a sky, you're a sky full of stars
Such a  heavenly  view
You're such a  heavenly  view
For a second, I was in control
I had it once, I lost it though
And all  along  the fire  below  would rise

And I wish you  could  have let me know
What's  really  going on below
I've lost you now, you let met go but one last time

Tell me you love me, if you don't then lie, oh lie to me

Remember once upon a time, when I was  yours  and you were blind
The fire  would  sparkle in your eyes and mine

So tell me you love me, if you don't then lie, oh lie to me
Just tell me you love, if you don't then lie, oh lie to me
If you don't then lie, oh lie to me
And call it true, call it true love
Call it true, call it true love
I  think  of you
I haven't slept
I  think  I do
But I don't forget
My body moves
Goes  where  I will
But  though  I try my  heart  stays still
It  never  moves
Just won't be led
And so my  mouth  waters to be fed
And you're  always  in my head
You're  always  in my head
You're  always  in my head
You're  always  in my head

It's been a night
Such a night
Such a long night
Watch  myself  disappear
Into the wild side
Said good bye to hard side
Sang, saw a  jackal  appear

Every road, that's wrong
Seems like the road, I'm on
Every sign just  seems  unclear
Won't you come  switch  me on
Don't know  where  I've gone
And I, I wish I was here

In a fight, such a fight
You love our fight
I'm not lying, this I swear
(The  demons  that hide inside
To the wild, why am I tired
How come I'm  never  there)

Every road, that's wrong
Seems like the road, I'm on
Every sign just  seems  unclear
Won't you come  switch  me on
Don't know  where  I've gone
And I, I wish I was here

And I, I wish I was here
And I, I wish I was here
Turn your  magic  on, to me she'd say
Everything you want's a  dream  away
We are legends,  every  day
That's what she told him

Turn your  magic  on, to me she'd say
Everything you want's a  dream  away
Under this pressure,  under  this weight
We are diamonds

I feel my  heart  beating
I feel my  heart  beneath my skin
I feel my  heart  beating
Oh, you make me feel
Like I'm  alive  again
Alive again
Oh, you make me feel
Like I'm  alive  again

Said I can't go on, not in this way
I'm a dream, I die by  light  of day
Gonna hold up half the sky and say
Only I own me

I feel my  heart  beating
I feel my  heart  beneath my skin
Oh, I can feel my  heart  beating
'Cause you make me feel
Like I'm  alive  again
Alive again
Oh, you make me feel
Like I'm  alive  again

Turn your  magic  on, to me she'd say
Everything you want's a  dream  away
Under this pressure,  under  this weight
We are  diamonds  taking shape
We are  diamonds  taking shape
(Woo hoo, woo hoo)

If we've only got this life
This  adventure  oh then  I
If we've only got this life
You'll get me through, oh
If we've only got this life
And this adventure, oh then I
Wanna  share  it with you
With you, with you
Sing it, oh, say yeah!

Sat on a roof
Named  every  star
Shed  every  bruise and
Showed  every  scar

Hope has its proof
Your hand in mine, singing
Life has a beautiful,  crazy  design
And time  seemed  to say
Forget the  world  and its weight
And here I just  wanna  say

Amazing day
Amazing day

Sat on a roof
Named  every  star and
Showed me a place
Where you can be who you are

And the view
The  whole  Milky Way
In your eyes
I'm  drifting  away
And in your arms
I just  wanna  sway

Amazing day
Amazing day
Amazing day
Amazing day

And I  asked  every book
Poetry and chime
Can  there  be breaks
In the  chaos  of the times?
Oh,  thanks  God
You must've  heard  when I prayed
Because now I always
Want to feel this way

Amazing day
Amazing day
Amazing day
Amazing day
It's today
Been  around  the world,  wonders  to view
Been  around  the world,  looking  for  someone  like you
Pyramids try,  babylon  too
But the beautiful-est  treasures  lie in the  deepest  blue

So I'll  never  say die, I'm  never  untrue
I'm  never  so high as when I'm with you
And  there  isn't a fire, that I wouldn't walk through
My army of one is  going  to  fight  for you

Been  around  the world,  universe  too
I've been  around  flying, baby, there's  nothing  I wouldn't do
Dance with the stars,  while  I see the moon
I'll be  standing  there  besides  you
Right when the  storm  comes through

'Cause I'll  never  say die, I'm  never  untrue
I'm  never  so high as when I'm with you
And  there  isn't a fire, that I wouldn't walk through
My army of one is  going  to  fight  for you
My army of one is  going  to fall for you, yeah

'Cause you're right, 'cause you're right
'Cause you're right
My army of one is  gonna  call it through

Say my  heart  is my gun, army of one
Yeah my  heart  is my gun, army of one
Is my only weapon, army of one
Say my  heart  is my gun, army of one

(So I race for it)
Stare into darkness,  staring  at doom
My  heart  boom, bo-boom boom
Stare into darkness,  admit  defeat
Coming home and I'm  finding  no peace

And I know, and I know and I know
I know I'm out of luck
And I know, and I know and I know
I know what you've got

So I put my  hands  up to the sky, feel alive
I've got a  rocketship  that I want to ride
I put my  hands  up to the sky, it's all right
Wherever you are, I'll find that treasure

(So I race for it)  wherever  you are, I'll find that treasure
(So I race for it)

Stare into darkness,  staring  at doom
You make my  heart  go boom, bo-boom boom
Superhero, a masterpiece
Been in a city but it  centered  around me

And I know, and I know and I know
I know I'm in luck
And I know, and I know and I know
I know when I'm not

I just put my  hands  up to the sky, feel alive
I've got a  rocketship  that I want to ride
I put my  hands  up to the sky, feel it inside
Wherever you are, I'll find that treasure

I just put my  hands  up to the sky,  feeling  alright
I've got a rocket, eyes on the prize
I put my  hands  up to the sky, I'm  gonna  find
Wherever you are, I'll find that treasure

(So I  reach  for it)  wherever  you are, I'll find that treasure
(So I  reach  for it)yeah yeah  wherever  you are, I'll find that treasure
(So I  reach  for it) and I know, and I know, and I know 
(So I  reach  for it) I know what I've got
X  marks  the spot
So I put my  hands  up to the sky,   feeling  alright
I've got a  rocketship  that I want to ride
I put my  hands  up to the sky, the  feeling  is like
Wherever you are, I'll find that treasure

I put my  hands  up to the sky,  feeling  alright
I've got a rocket, eyes on the price
I put my  hands  up to the sky, I'm  gonna  fly
Wherever you are, I'll find that treasure, yeah yeah  wherever  you are
Standing in the corner
Studying the lights
Dreaming of escape
Could be up at night

Someone put the  fares  up
Got me in raise
So  guess  it's  better  to stay

Well, come on and say
Well, the food's  gonna  find us
Just the  water  and rain
Don't let the fear install
I  wanna  see you again
I hear you  never  wanna,  sleep  all night
Just not  falling  in love
Stop the ride, come on rage with me

Don't need notes
We'll be birds
To make you look in

Look up this morning
You and me
Get you off your feet

Come on,  raise  it
Come on  raise  this noise
One  million  people, and not one voice
Come on, it's not over
For me, sing loud
Come on,  awful  love, come away with me
We don't need words

Close your eyes and see
The  lumpy  boats
Falling free
Fall in love and I  missed  you

Free as free and free
We'll go  through  this together
Fly won't you
Won't you take me too?
In this  world  so cruel
I  think  you're so cool
Because each has been sent
As a guide
We see  people  coming
See  people  go
This  particular  timing is  extra  special
I know you  might  be gone
And the  world  may not know
Still, I see you celestial

Like a lion you ran
Goddess, he wrote
Like an eagle, you circle
Perfect of all
So how come  things  move on?
How come cars don’t slow?
When it  feels  like the end of the world
When I  should  but I can’t let you go

But when I’m cold, cold
When I’m cold, cold
There’s a  light  that you give me
When I’m in shadows
There’s a  feeling  of ever, everglow

We’re  brothers  in that
The  sisters  you write
When we  stroll  on like that
Be  friends  ‘til we die
With the  changing  of winds
And the way  waters  flow
Life is  shortest  in fall, in the snow
I know I’m  going  to miss you, I know

But when I’m cold, cold
Yeah, all alone, the sun
And I know that you’re with me
And the way you will show, when you’re with me  wherever  I go
But you give me this feeling, it’s everglow

What I wouldn't give for this  moment  to hold
Yeah, I live for this feeling, it’s everglow

So if you love someone, you  should  let them know
Oh, the  light  that you left me will everglow
I know it's over  before  she says
I know it  falls  at the  water  face
I know it's over, an  ocean  awaits
For a storm
The sun and snow
Rivers and rain
Crystal ball  could  foresee a change
And I know it's over,  parting  our ways
And it's done

But didn't we have fun?
Don't say it was all a waste
Didn't we have fun?
Oh-oh-oh
From the top of the world
Top of the waves
You said forever,  forever  always
We  could  have been lost
We  would  have been saved
Oh, I-aaah
Now we're  stopping  the world,  stopping  it's spin
Oh come on don't give up
You see me give in
Don't say it's over
Don't say we're done
Oh, didn't we have fun?
Woo-oh-oh-oh
Woo-oh-oh-oh
Woo-oh-oh-oh
Oh, didn't we have fun?

I know it's over  before  she says
Now  someone  else has  taken  your place
I know it's over  Icarus  says to the sun
And so it  sinks  in,  lightning  strikes
You're too  forced  to  force  his glide
The fact that it's over, the fact that it's done
Ah-ah-ah

Didn't we have fun?
Don't say it was all a waste
Didn't we have fun?
Oh-oh
From the top of the world
Top of the waves
You said forever,  forever  always
We  could  have been lost
We  would  have been saved
Oh, I-aaah
Now we're  stopping  the world,  stopped  it in its tracks
Nothing's too  broken  to find our way back
So  before  it's over,  before  you run
Ah, didn't we have fun?

Just you and me
We were  always  meant to,  always  meant to
Be
We were  always  meant to,  always  meant to
You and me
We were  always  meant to,  always  meant to
Be
Oh-ooh-ooh
Oh-ooh-ooh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, didn't we have fun?
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, didn't we have fun?
But didn't?
Maybe we  could  again
Oh, I  think  I've landed
In a  world  I hadn't seen
When I'm  feeling  ordinary
When I don't know what I mean

Oh, I  think  I've landed
Where  there  are  miracles  at work
For the  thirst  and for the hunger
Come the  conference  of birds

And say it's true
It's not what it seems
Leave your  broken  windows open
And in the  light  just streams

And you get a head
A head full of dreams
You can see the  change  you want to
Be what you want to be

When you get a head
A head full of dreams
It's a love, I’ve just been spoken
With a head full, a head full of dreams

Oh, I  think  I've landed
Where  there  are  miracles  at work
There you've got me open handed
When you got a lost of words

I sing, oh
Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh
A head full of dreams
Oh
Oh
Oh
A head full of dreams
Oh
It's a love, I've just been spoken
With a head full, a head full of dreams
Drink from me,  drink  from me (oh-ah-oh-ah)
Then we'll  shoot  across the (symphony)
Then we'll  shoot  across the sky
Drink from me,  drink  from me (oh-ah-oh-ah)
Then we'll  shoot  across the (oh-ah-oh-ah)
Symphony
(So high, so high)
Then we'll  shoot  across the sky

Oh,  angels  sent from up above
You know you make my  world  light up
When I was down, when I was hurt
You came to lift me up
Life is a drink, and love's a drug
Oh now I  think  I must be  miles  up
When I was hurt, withered,  dried  up
You came to rain a flood

So  drink  from me,  drink  from me
When I was so thirsty
We're on a symphony
Now I just can't get enough
Put your  wings  on me,  wings  on me
When I was so heavy
We're on a symphony
When I'm lower, lower, lower, low

Ah-oh-ah-oh-ah
Got me  feeling  drunk and high
So high, so high
Oh-ah-oh-ah-oh-ah
I'm  feeling  drunk and high
So high, so high
(Woo)
(Woo-ooo-ooo-woo)

Oh,  angels  sent from up above
I feel it  coursing  through my blood
Life is a drink, your love's about
To make the  stars  come out

Put your  wings  on me,  wings  on me
When I was so heavy
We're on a symphony
When I'm lower, lower, lower, low

Ah-oh-ah-oh-ah
Got me  feeling  drunk and high
So high, so high
Oh-ah-oh-ah-oh-ah

La, la, la, la, la, la, la
So high, so high

So high, so high

Then we'll  shoot  across the sky
Then we'll  shoot  across the
Then we'll  shoot  across the sky
Then we'll  shoot  across the (then we'll shoot)
Then we'll  shoot  across the sky
Then we'll  shoot  across the
Then we'll  shoot  across the sky
Then we'll  shoot  across the
This  being  human is a  guest  house
Every  morning  a new arrival

A joy, a depression, a meanness
Some  momentary  awareness comes
As an  unexpected  visitor

Welcome and  entertain  them all!
Be  grateful  for  whoever  comes
Because each has been sent as a guide
Fixing up a car to  drive  in it again
Searching for the water,  hoping  for the rain
Up and up
Up and up

Down upon the canvas,  working  meal to meal
Waiting for a  chance  to pick on your  orange  field
Up and up
Up and up

See a  pearl  form, a  diamond  in the rough
See a bird  soaring  high  above  the flood
It’s in your blood
It’s in your blood

Underneath the  storm  an  umbrella  is saying
Sitting with the  poison  takes away the pain
Up and up
Up and up, saying

We're  gonna  get it, get it  together  right now
Gonna get it, get it  together  somehow
Gonna get it, get it  together  and flower
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
We're  gonna  get it, get it  together  I know
Gonna get it, get it  together  and flow
Gonna get it, get it  together  and go
Up and up and up

Lying in the gutter,  aiming  for the moon
Trying to  empty  out the  ocean  with a spoon
Up and up 
Up and up

How can  people  suffer, how can  people  part?
How can  people  struggle
How can  people  break your heart?
Break your heart

Yes I  wanna  grow, yes I  wanna  feel
Yes I  wanna  know
Show me how to heal it up
Heal it up

See the  forest  there in  every  seed
Angels in the  marble  waiting to be freed
Just need love, just need love
When the  going  is rough, saying

We're  gonna  get it, get it  together  right now
Gonna get it, get it  together  somehow
Gonna get it, get it  together  and flower
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
We're  gonna  get it, get it  together  I know
Gonna get it, get it  together  and flow
Gonna get it, get it  together  and go

And you can say what is, or  fight  for it
Close your mind and take a risk
You can "it's mine" and  clench  your fist
Or see each  other  as a gift

We're  gonna  get it, get it  together  right now
Gonna get it, get it  together  somehow
Gonna get it, get it  together  and flower
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
We're  gonna  get it, get it  together  I know
Gonna get it, get it  together  and flow
Gonna get it, get it  together  and go
Up and up and up

We're  gonna  get it, get it  together  right now
Gonna get it, get it  together  somehow
Gonna get it, get it  together  and flower
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
We're  gonna  get it, get it  together  I know
Gonna get it, get it  together  and flow
Gonna get it, get it  together  and go
Up and up and up

Fixing up a car to  drive  in it again
When you’re in pain
When you  think  you’ve had enough
Don’t ever give up
Don’t ever give up
'Cause you're a sky, 'cause you're a sky full of stars
I'm  gonna  give you my heart
'Cause you're a sky, 'cause you're a sky full of stars
'Cause you  light  up the path

I don't care, go on and tear me apart
I don't care if you do, ooh
'Cause in a sky, 'cause in a sky full of stars
I  think  I saw you

'Cause you're a sky, 'cause you're a sky full of stars
I  wanna  die in your arms
'Cause you get  lighter  the more it gets dark
I'm  gonna  give you my heart

I don't care if you do, ooh
'Cause in a sky, 'cause in a sky full of stars

'Cause you're a sky, you're a sky full of stars
Such a  heavenly  view
You're such a  heavenly  view
From up  above  I heard
The  angels  sing to me  these  words
And  sometimes  in your eyes
I see the  beauty  in the world

Oh, now I'm  floating  so high
I  blossom  and die
Send your  storm  and your  lightning  to strike
Me  between  the eyes
Eyes

Sometimes the  stars  decide
To  reflect  in  puddles  in the dirt
When I look in your eyes
I  forget  all  about  what hurts

Oh, now I'm  floating  so high
I  blossom  and die
Send your  storm  and your  lightning  to strike
Me  between  the eyes
And cry

Believe in miracles

Oh hey, I'm  floating  up  above  the  world  now
Oh hey, I'm  floating  up  above  the  world  now

Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Uh, uh, uh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Uh, uh, uh
Oh,  angel  sent from up above
You know you make my  world  light up
When I was down, when I was hurt
You came to lift me up
Life is a  drink  and love's a drug
Oh, now I  think  I must be  miles  up
When I was a  river  dried up
You came to rain a flood

Ah-oh-ah-oh-ah
Got me  feeling  drunk and high
So high, so high
Ah-oh-ah-oh-ah
Now I’m  feeling  drunk and high
So high, so high
Feeling  drunk  and high
Feeling  drunk  and high
So high

Oh,  angel  sent from up above
I feel it  coursing  through my blood
Life is a drink, your love's about
To make the  stars  come out

Ah-oh-ah-oh-ah
Got me  feeling  drunk and high
So high, so high
Ah-oh-ah-oh-ah
Now I’m  feeling  drunk and high
So high, so high
Feeling  drunk  and high
Feeling  drunk  and high
So high

Been  rusting  in rubble
Running to a faint
Need a  brand  new coat of paint
I  found  myself in trouble
Thinking 'bout what ain't
Never  gonna  be a saint
Saying  float  like an eagle
Fall like the rain
Pouring to put out the pain
Oh  again  and again

Now I'm hyp, hypnotised
Yeah I trip, when I look in your eyes
Oh I'm hyp, hypnotised
Yeah I slip and I'm mesmerized

It's easy to be lethal
Learning from the news
It's a  guidebook  for the blues
Saying it's the very same steeple
People  wanna  chose
They just see it from  different  views
And  threading  the needle
Fixing my flame
Oh, oh now I'm  moved  to exclaim
Oh again, and again

How I'm hyp, hypnotised
Yeah I trip, when I look in your eyes
Oh I'm hyp, hypnotized
Yeah I lift and I'm mesmerized

Oh-oh oh, oh-oh oh, oh-oh-oh oh-oh oohh

Oh again, and again
And I'm hyp, hypnotised
Yeah I lift to a  permanent  high
Oh I'm hyp, hypnotised
It was dark
Now it's sunrise
Fish fell out of water
Bird  stuck  on the ground
Chaos  giving  orders
Everything is  upside  down
Whole world's  gonna  fly by
I  wonder  where they'll go, oh
Trouble's on the outside, I know
So now, all I can  think  about is you

All I can  think  about is you
We fall in a wonderland
So low
A  wonderland  for you
I  wanna  walk into

It's all I can
It's all I can
It's all I can
It's all I can do
It's all I can do
All I can  think  about is you

We were just  about  to lose our home
Diamonds ate the radio
Moving in the dead of night
We took  photographs  just some just so
History  someone  to know
We were  moving  at the  speed  of flight

Kids cry
If you want to
That's alright
If you want to
Hold me
Hold me tight

Just an alien

We were  hovering  without a home
Millions are UFO
Hovering in hope some  scope  tonight
Sees the  light  and says

Fly if you want to
That's alright
But if you want to
Call me
Call this line
 
Just an alien
Just an alien
Oh, we just want to get home again

Tell your leader
Sir or ma'am
We come in peace
We mean no harm
Somewhere out there
In the unknown
All the E.T.'s are  phoning  home
Watching my life
On the skyline
Crossing your eyes
All a lifetime

Just an  alien  (moving target)
Target movement
Oh, we just want to get home again
Of the  space  time
Turning forward
Turning pages
Over Asia
Crossing ages
Just an alien
Oh, we just want to get home again
My  father  said  never  give up son
Just look how good  Cassius  become
Mohammed, Mahatma, and Nelson
Not  scared  to be strong

Now you  could  run and just say they're right
No I'll  never  be no one in my  whole  life
Or you  could  turn and see the way they're wrong
And get to keep on  dancing  all life long

My  father  said  never  give up, son
Just look what  Amelia  and Joan done
Or Rosa, Teresa, the war won
Not  scared  to be strong

Now you  could  run and just say they're right
No I'll  never  be no one in my  whole  life
Or you  could  turn and see the way they're wrong
And get to keep on  dancing  all life long
Yeah you  could  be

Someone special
You've got  bright  in your  brains  and
Lightning in your veins
You'll go  higher  then they've ever gone
In you I see
Someone special
You've got fire in your eyes and
When you  realize  
You'll go  further  then we've ever gone (look)
Just turn it on

I pay my  intuition  I couldn't  afford  tuition
My  funds  was  insufficient  and it felt I'm in prison
Until I  realized  I had to set my mind free
I was  trusting  statistics more than I  trust  me
Get a degree, good job, 401k
But I'm  trying  to turn Ks to Ms what does it take?
And  maybe  I  could  be the new Ali of music, probably
Instead of  doing  it just as a  hobby  like  these  boys told me to
I  guess  you  either  watch the show or you're showin' proof
Prove it to them you  prove  it to  yourself  
But  honestly  its  better  if you do it for yourself
Never  complacent  'til we hit the oasis
One life don't  waste  it feel my  heart  races,  success  I  taste  it, I
We on the  verge  again and  every  single day that we deserve

Yeah you  could  be 
Someone special
You've got fire in your eyes 
I see  heaven  inside 
You'll go  further  then we've ever gone
In you I see 
Someone special
You've got  bright  in your  brains  
You can  break  through  those  chains 
You'll go  higher  then we've ever gone
Just turn it on

In you I see 
Someone special
Don't go to war with yourself
Just turn, just turn, just turn it on
And you can't go wrong
I've been  reading  books of old
The  legends  and the myths
Achilles and his gold
Hercules and his gifts
Spiderman's control
And  Batman  with his fists
And  clearly  I don't see  myself  upon that list

But she said, where'd you  wanna  go?
How much you  wanna  risk?
I'm not  looking  for somebody
With some  superhuman  gifts
Some superhero
Some  fairytale  bliss
Just  something  I can turn to
Somebody I can kiss

I want  something  just like this
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Oh, I want  something  just like this
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo

Oh, I want  something  just like this
I want  something  just like this

I've been  reading  books of old
The  legends  and the myths
The  testaments  they told
The moon and its eclipse
And  Superman  unrolls
A suit  before  he lifts
But I'm not the kind of  person  that it fits

She said, where'd you  wanna  go?
How much you  wanna  risk?
I'm not  looking  for somebody
With some  superhuman  gifts
Some superhero
Some  fairytale  bliss
Just  something  I can turn to
Somebody I can miss

I want  something  just like this
Oh, I want  something  just like this

Oh, I want  something  just like this
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo (Your turn!)
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo

Oh, I want  something  just like this
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo

Where'd you  wanna  go?
How much you  wanna  risk?
I'm not  looking  for somebody
With some  superhuman  gifts
Some superhero
Some  fairytale  bliss
Just  something  I can turn to
Somebody I can kiss
I want  something  just like this

Oh, I want  something  just like this

Something just like this

Oh, I want  something  just like this

Oh, I want  something  just like this

Arigato!
Arigato gozaimasu!
I've been  reading  books of old
The  legends  and the myths
Achilles and his gold
Hercules and his gifts
Spiderman's control
And  Batman  with his fists
And  clearly  I don't see  myself  upon that list

But she said, where'd you  wanna  go?
How much you  wanna  risk?
I'm not  looking  for somebody
With some  superhuman  gifts
Some superhero
Some  fairytale  bliss
Just  something  I can turn to
Somebody I can kiss

I want  something  just like this
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Oh, I want  something  just like this
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Oh, I want  something  just like this

I want  something  just like this

I've been  reading  books of old
The  legends  and the myths
The  testaments  they told
The moon and its eclipse
And  Superman  unrolls
A suit  before  he lifts
But I'm not the kind of  person  that it fits

She said, where'd you  wanna  go?
How much you  wanna  risk?
I'm not  looking  for somebody
With some  superhuman  gifts
Some superhero
Some  fairytale  bliss
Just  something  I can turn to
Somebody I can miss

I want  something  just like this
I want  something  just like this

I want  something  just like this
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Oh, I want  something  just like this
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo

Where'd you  wanna  go?
How much you  wanna  risk?
I'm not  looking  for somebody
With some  superhuman  gifts
Some superhero
Some  fairytale  bliss
Just  something  I can turn to
Somebody I can kiss
I want  something  just like this

Oh, I want  something  just like this
Oh, I want  something  just like this
Oh, I want  something  just like this
Wise men say
It  looks  like rain today
It  crackled  on the speakers
And  trickled  down the  sleepy  subway trains
Heavy eyes  could  hardly hold us
Aching legs that  often  told us
It's all  worth  it
We all fall in love sometimes

The full moon's bright
And  starlight  filled the evening
We  wrote  it and I  played  it
Something  happened  it's so  strange  this feeling
Naive  notions  that were childish
Simple  tunes  that  tried  to hide it
But when it comes
We all fall in love sometimes

Did we, didn't we,  should  we, couldn't we
I'm not sure 'cause  sometimes  we're so blind
Struggling  through  the day
When even your best  friend  says
Don't you find
We all fall in love sometimes

Wise men say
It  looks  like rain today
It  crackled  on the speakers
And  trickled  down the  sleepy  subway trains
Heavy eyes  could  hardly hold us
Aching legs that  often  told us
It's all  worth  it
But we all fall in love sometimes

We all fall in love sometimes
We all fall in love sometimes
We all fall in love, sometimes
