That's why I'm all into you

'Cause I can  recognize  that you know that

That's why I'm backin' this  thing  back

Pop poppin' this  thing  back

Drop drop drop  dropping  this  thing  back

This is for the time, you gave me flowers

For the world, that is ours

For the mulah, for the  power  of love

I know I won't  never  ever eh-ever give you up

And I  wanna  say  thank  you in case I don't  thank  you enough

A  woman  in the  street  and the  freak  in the you know what

Sit back sit back it's the pre game show

Daddy you know what's up



Loving you is  really  all that's on my mind

And I can't help but to  think  about it day and night

I  wanna  make that body rock, sit back and watch

Baby  lemme  put my body on your body

Promise not to tell  nobody  'cause

It's bout to go down



I'mma take this time

To show you how much you mean to me

'Cause you all I need

No  money  can  emphasize  or describe

The love that's in  between  the lines

Boy look into my eyes

While I'm  grinding  on you

This is  beyond  sex

I'm high on you

If it's real then you know how I feel

Rockin' on you babe

Rockin' rockin' on you babe

Swirlin' on you babe

In my mind all I can  think  about

Is a  frame  for our future

And the  pictures  of the past

And a  chance  to make this love last



Tonight I'm  gonna  dance for you (ohh ooh ohh ohhh)

Tonight I'm  gonna  dance for you (ohh ooh ohh ohhh)

Tonight I'm  gonna  put my body on your body

Swirlin' on you babe swirlin'  swirlin  on you babe

Baby  lemme  put my body on your body

Promise not to tell  nobody  'cause

It's bout to go downLook for me, Young, B	

Cruisin' down the west-side, highway

Doing what we like to do, our way

Eyes  behind  shades, this  necklace  the reason

All of my  dates  been  blind  dates

But  today  I got my  thoroughest  girl wit' me

I'm mashin' the gas, she's grabbin' the wheel; it's true to the heart

She  rides  with me--the new  Bobby  and Whitney

Only time we don't  speak  is  during  "Sex and the City"

She gets  Carrie  fever, but soon as the show is over

She's  right  back to  being  my soldier

'Cause mami's a  rider  and I'm a roller

Put us together--how they gon' stop both us?

Whatever she lacks, I'm  right  over her shoulder

When I'm off track, mami is keepin' me focused

So let's lock this down like it's  supposed  to be

The '03  Bonnie  and Clyde, Hov' and B	



[Chorus]

All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend

Down to ride till the very end it's me and my boyfriend

All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend

Down to ride till the very end it's me and my boyfriend



The  problem  is you  dudes  treat the one that you lovin'

With the same  respect  that you  treat  the one that you humpin'

Dat ain't 'bout nothin

If ever you mad  about  somethin', it won't be that, oh no, it won't be that

I don't be at  places  where we  comfy  at

With no be-atch; oh no, you won't see that

And, no, I ain't perfect;  nobody  walkin' this earth's  surface  is

But, girlfriend, work with the kid

I keep you workin' at Hermes, Birkin' bag

Manolo Blahnik, Timbs,  aviator  lens

600 drops,  Mercedes  Benz

The only time you wear  Burberry  to swim

And I don't have to worry--only  worry  is him

She'd do  anything  necessary for him

And I'd do  anything  necessary for her

So don't let the  necessary  occur, yup



[Chorus]



(Talk to 'em, B)

If I was your girlfriend

I'll be  there  for you if  somebody  hurts you

Even if the  somebody  was me

(Break it down for 'em, B)

Sometimes I trip on how  happy  we  could  be

And so I put this on my life

Nobody or  nothing  will ever come  between  us

And I  promise  I'll give my life

My love and my  trust  if you was my boyfriend

Put this on my life

The air that I  breathe  in, all that I  believe  in

I  promise  I'll give my life

My love and my  trust  if you was my boyfriend



[Chorus]Remember  those  walls I built

Well, baby, they're  tumbling  down

And they didn't even put up a fight

They didn't even make a sound



I  found  a way to let you win

But I  never  really had a doubt

Standing in the  light  of your halo

I got my  angel  now



It's like I've been awakened

Every rule I had you  break  it

It's the risk that I'm taking

I ain't  never  gonna shut you out



Everywhere I'm  looking  now

I'm  surrounded  by your embrace

Baby, I can see your halo

You know you're my  saving  grace



You're  everything  I need and more

It's  written  all over your face

Baby, I can feel your halo

Pray it won't fade away



I can feel your halo (halo) halo

I can see your halo (halo) halo

I can feel your halo (halo) halo

I can see your halo (halo) halo



Hit me like a ray of sun

Burning  through  my  darkest  night

You're the only one that I want

Think I'm  addicted  to your light



I  swore  I'd  never  fall again

But this don't even feel like falling

Gravity can't forget

To pull me back to the  ground  again



Feels like I've been awakened

Every rule I had you  break  it

The risk that I'm taking

I'm  never  gonna shut you out



Everywhere I'm  looking  now

I'm  surrounded  by your embrace

Baby, I can see your halo

You know you're my  saving  grace



You're  everything  I need and more

It's  written  all over your face

Baby, I can feel your halo

Pray it won't fade away



I can feel your halo (halo) halo

I can see your halo (halo) halo

Part two, it's so  crazy  right now



I look and  stare  so deep in your eyes

I  touch  on you more and more  every  time

When you  leave  I'm  begging  you not to go

Call your name two or  three  times in a row



Such a  funny  thing for me to try to explain

How I'm  feeling  and my  pride  is the one to blame

'Cause I know I don't understand

Just how your love you're  doing  no one else can



Got me  looking  so  crazy  right now, your love's

When I talk to my  friends  so quietly

Who he  think  he is? Look at what you did to me

Tennis shoes, don't even need to buy a new dress

If you ain't  there  ain't  nobody  else to impress



The way that you know what I  thought  I knew

It's the beat that my  heart  skips when I'm with you

But I  still  don't understand

Just how the love your  doing  no one else can



Got me  looking  so  crazy  right now, your love's

Got me  looking  so  crazy  right now

(Oh crazy)

Got me  looking  so  crazy  right now, your touch

[Chorus]

Crazy  feelings  

Make me stay

In love with you 

Crazy feelings

Make me stay

In love with you



So in love

I just didn't see the  wrong  you did

In love

But now that I know I can  admit  

It was love

That made me a fool, a  silly  fool

In love, oh, crazy



[Chorus]



You was  always  in my face

All the time

Even with 20/20 vision

I couldn't see you lie

You was  always  in my face

All the time

Even with 20/20 vision

I couldn't see you lie 



[Chorus: x2]Here I am
Looking in the mirror
An open face, the pain erased
Now the sky is clearer
I can see the sun
Now that all is, all is said and done, oh

There you are
Always  strong  when I need you
You let me give
And now I live,  fearless  and protected
With the one I will love
After all is, all is said and done

I once  believed  that  hearts  were made to bleed
(Inside I once  believed  that  hearts  were made to bleed, ohbaby)
But now I´m not  afraid  to say

I need you, I need you so stay with me
These  precious  (precious)  hours  (yeah)
Greet each dawn in open arms
And dream, into tomorrow

Where there´s only love
After all is, all is said and done

(Yeah baby) Oh baby
(Inside I once believed, that  hearts  were  meant  to bleed)

(I´ll never)
I´ll  never  be  afraid  to say
I need you, I need you, so here

Here we are in the  still  of this moment
Fear is gone, hope  lives  on

We  found  our  happy  ending
For there´s only love (only love)
And this sweet,  sweet  love
After all is, all is said and done

Yeah baby  after  all is (all is)
All is said and doneUh, uh-huh

Ever  since  cats  found  out I ran with the Roc

They  wanna  take a  closer  look,  wanna  examine the box

Magazine want  cameras  to pop

They  catch  me in the nude like a  Samantha  Fox

Listen dude but I got  dollars  and cents

You don't  gotta  promise me to pay my rent

I got that

(I got that)

Catch me a drop  black  playing  Speedy  Gonzalez

Toes  never  unpolished

The way I be  dressing  dudes  wanna  toss the salad

The way I be  dressing  got  broads  acting childish

But I pay my own bills

Y'all got that?

Am I  crazy  to live this way see



I know I'm wrong, I'm  shamed  everyday

We're not as one, but you  think  it's okay

My life is not  meant  to be  lived  this way, this way

You  promised  me one day we  would  be

Husband and wife but it  seems  to me

You're  moving  further away from me, from me



Lord I'm  trying  to do what's  pleasing  in your sight

But I'm in love,  right  now I'm  caught  up

Instead of leaving, I know that you'll be  right  by my side

And you'll make a way, just have your way



I  spent  too much time  playin  wife on many nights

Keepin you happy,  giving  you all of me

I wake up  every  morning  feeling  guilty  cause  you're  lying  next to me

Father  forgive  me,  thought  by now we'd be married



Four  months  ago you  promised  me

By now I'd have my  wedding  ring

You've  shown  no  commitment  to me, to me

I  cannot  blame you for  using  me

If I  continue  to let this be

Cause  shacking  with a man just ain't me, ain't me



Lord I'm  trying  to do what's  pleasing  in your sight

Remember the  first  day when you took me out
We had butterflies,  although  we  tried  to hide it
And we both had a  beautiful  night

The way we held each  others  hand
The way we talked, the way we laughed
It felt so good to find true love
I knew  right  then and  there  you were the one

I know that he  loves  me 'cause he told me so
I know that he  loves  me 'cause his  feelings  show
And when he  stares  at me
You see he  cares  for me
You see how he is so deep in love
I know that he  loves  me 'cause it's obvious
I know that he  loves  me 'cause it's me he trusts
And he's missin' me if he's not kissin' me
And when he  looks  at me, his  brown  eyes tell his soul

Remember the  first  day, the  first  day we kissed
Remember the  first  day we had an argument
We apologized, and then we compromised
And we haven't  argued  since
Remember the  first  day we  stopped  playing games
Remember the  first  day you fell in love with me
It felt so good for you to say  those  words
'Cause I felt the same way too

The way we held each  others  hands
The way we talked, the way we laughed
It felt so good to fall in love
And I knew  right  then and  there  you were the one

I know that he  loves  me 'cause he told me so
I know that he  loves  me 'cause his  feelings  show
And when he  stares  at me
You see he  cares  for me
You see how he is so deep in love
I know that he  loves  me 'cause it's obvious
I know that he  loves  me 'cause it's me he trusts
And he's missin' me if he's not kissin' me
And when he  looks  at me, his  brown  eyes tell his soul

I'm so happy, so  happy  that you're in my life and baby
Now that you're a part of me you've  shown  me
Shown me the true  meaning  of love (the true  meaning  of love)
And I know he  loves  me

I know that he  loves  me 'cause he told me so
I know that he  loves  me 'cause his  feelings  show
And when he  stares  at me
You see he  cares  for me
You see how he is so deep in love
I know that he  loves  me 'cause it's obvious
I know that he  loves  me 'cause it's me he trusts
And he's missin' me if he's not kissin' me
And when he  looks  at me, his  brown  eyes tell his soul

He  looks  at me and his  brown  eyes tell it soYou're  holding  me

I  close  my eyes

You're whispering

And I  start  to cry



You feel so good

So beautiful

For as long as you live

Don't let me go



Just hold me

Touch me

Feel me

As long as you love me



Reach for me

And need me

If you  could  trust me

And  teach  me



Never let go of me

Because you're half of me

My  heart  still beats

Looking in the eyes



The eyes of love

I hold your face

And I see the sun

And I  taste  your kiss



You  touch  my soul

I'm  feeling  things

I've  never  felt before

Just hold me



Touch me

Feel me

As long as you love me

Reach for me



And need me

If you  could  trust me

And  teach  me

Never let go of me



Because you're half for me

My  heart  still beats



I am feeling

What they call pure love

I  never  know

Feelings like this



Could exist

Inside of me

I'm soaring

Emotions exploding



I don't want to live

Another day if you're

Not here with me

Just hold me



Touch me

Feel me

As long as you love me

Reach for me



And need me

If you  could  trust me

And  teach  me

Never let go of me



Because you're half of me

My  heart  still beats

Because you're half of me,



My  heart  still beats

My  heart  still beatsHow ya doin',  honey  baby?

You know I don't ask for much

But for a girl spendin' time  alone  can be  pretty  rough



But I get a  knock  on my door

I know it's  yours  for sure

We can't wait for the bedroom, so we just hit the floor



[Chorus]

Is y'all all right?

I don't know, but I know what's  happened  to me, girl, hey

Is y'all all right?

Uh,  break  it down now

He  gotta  work it out

He  gotta  work it out

A  brother  gotta work it out

Whoa, whoa



Child, blow your horn now

Come on, child, blow your horn now



So we're shakin' back and  forth  now

Just keep it comin', babe

Treat my body like a guitar

You gotta, you  gotta  keep on strummin'



But in the back of my mind

Is it  gonna  be the last time?

Well, if it ain't  about  lovin' and you gon' keep it comin'

Well, baby, with me that's fine



[Chorus]



Child, blow your horn now

Come on, child, blow your horn now



I like this

Oh, oh, hey

Uh

Look-a here

Bring it



So, baby, hold me like you don't want to let go

I'm  feeling  foxy 'cause, boy, you're workin' it out

My love, you've  given  me a  taste  of your honey

I want the  whole  beehive

I'm  gonna  call you my  sugar  to fly high

The  sweetest  time



You  gotta  work it out

You  gotta  work it out

Brother  gotta  work it out

Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh



I like it when the horn go

I like it when the horn go

I like it when the horn go

I like it when the horn go



Austin  better  work it out

Foxy  better  work it out

AP3  better  work it out

AP3  better  work it outLook for me, Young, B
Cruisin' down the west-side, highway
Doing what we like to do, our way
Eyes  behind  shades, this  necklace  the reason
All of my  dates  been  blind  dates
But  today  I got my  thoroughest  girl wit' me
I'm mashin' the gas, she's grabbin' the wheel; it's true to the heart
She  rides  with me--the new  Bobby  and Whitney
Only time we don't  speak  is  during  "Sex and the City"
She gets  Carrie  fever, but soon as the show is over
She's  right  back to  being  my soldier
'Cause mami's a  rider  and I'm a roller
Put us together--how they gon' stop both us?
Whatever she lacks, I'm  right  over her shoulder
When I'm off track, mami is keepin' me focused
So let's lock this down like it's  supposed  to be
The '03  Bonnie  and Clyde, Hov' and B

All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride till the very end it's me and my boyfriend
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride till the very end it's me and my boyfriend

The  problem  is you  dudes  treat the one that you lovin'
With the same  respect  that you  treat  the one that you humpin'
Dat ain't 'bout nothin
If ever you mad  about  somethin', it won't be that, oh no, it won't be that
I don't be at  places  where we  comfy  at
With no be-atch; oh no, you won't see that
And, no, I ain't perfect;  nobody  walkin' this earth's  surface  is
But, girlfriend, work with the kid
I keep you workin' at Hermes, Birkin' bag
Manolo Blahnik, Timbs,  aviator  lens
600 drops,  Mercedes  Benz
The only time you wear  Burberry  to swim
And I don't have to worry--only  worry  is him
She'd do  anything  necessary for him
And I'd do  anything  necessary for her
So don't let the  necessary  occur, yup

All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride till the very end it's me and my boyfriend
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride till the very end it's me and my boyfriend

(Talk to 'em, B)
If I was your girlfriend
I'll be  there  for you if  somebody  hurts you
Even if the  somebody  was me
(Break it down for 'em, B)
Sometimes I trip on how  happy  we  could  be
And so I put this on my life
Nobody or  nothing  will ever come  between  us
And I  promise  I'll give my life
My love and my  trust  if you was my boyfriend
Put this on my life
The air that I  breathe  in, all that I  believe  in
I  promise  I'll give my life
My love and my  trust  if you was my boyfriend

All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride till the very end it's me and my boyfriend
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride till the very end it's me and my boyfriend[Beyonce]

And I ain't came  across  nothin' so sweet

He's the only man that I love

And I don't need more than one

So don't  worry  when I'm  hanging  out

He's the only one that I am  thinking  about!



I know he's insecure

Every time I  leave  out the door

To  explain  to

You what it is

That you do to me

Got me open

I am so in

Love with  loving  you



Touching places

No one else has

Ever made me

Feel incredible

When you  touch  me

I feel sexy

No one else like you



Got me  going  off all the love you give me

I'd be  crazy  to love one to leave

I love the way your  hands  love my body

Please, don't say your  gonna  stop  loving  me



[Chorus]

Oh, keep  giving  your love to me 

Oh, keep  giving  your love to me

Oh, when you're  giving  your love to me

Oh, it's like you're  making  love to me

Oh, keep  giving  your love to me 

Oh, keep  giving  your love to me

Oh, the way you're  giving  your love to me

Oh, it's like you're  making  love to me



I lose all control

When you are

Near and, baby

It  amazes  me

How  could  someone

Be so sexy

And love like you do?



Baby, do you

Understand the 

Power that you

Posses over me?

Can't  escape  this

Feeling and I

Don't  think  I want to



Got me  going  off all the love you give me

I'd be  crazy  to love one to leave

I love the way your  hands  love my body

Please, don't say your  gonna  stop  loving  me



[Chorus]



It's  crazy  how much I'm in love with you

You're so kind you love me the way you do

Don't want no  other  love but you

'Cause no one else has ever made me feel this good



[Chorus]

I  touch  on you more and more  every  time

When you leave, I'm  begging  you not to go

Call your name two or  three  times in a row

Such a  funny  thing for me to try to explain

How I'm  feeling  and my  pride  is the one to blame

'Cause I know I don't understand

Tennis shoes, don't even need to buy a new dress

If you ain't there, ain't  nobody  else to impress

It's the way that you know what I  thought  I knew

It's the beat my  heart  skips when I'm with you

But I  still  don't understand

[Repeat  until  fade]Out of all the guys that  approach  me

Walking up to me like they know me

You were the one that  stayed  aside

Waited a  while  and took your time

You don't know how impressing

Your  curiosity  was to me

It was the  fourth  day of July

Looked in my eyes and saw that I



I  wanted  more than just a man

I  needed  a friend

Someone I can talk to,  someone  who  really  listens

When you  touched  my hand, the sun got  brighter  then

Trusting you, I  closed  my eyes and felt our love begin



It was the  summertime  

When we fell in love, it was the  summertime  

Heaven  shined  on us; it was the  summertime  

Baby,  there  is  nothing  like the summertime

Summertime



Now it's been a year and we're closer

Fall in love  again  when I hold ya

I know that God set you  aside  for me

And now you are my prize

Wanna grow old wit'cha

And fill our  house  with your pictures

Have a son for you

A  little  girl for me

Together we'll  raise  a family



Baby, you're more than just a man

You are my best friend

Someone I can talk to,  someone  who  really  listens

When you  touched  my hand, the sun got  brighter  then

Trusting you, I  closed  my eyes and felt our love begin



It was the summertime

When we fell in love, it was the summertime

Heaven  shined  on us; it was the summertime

Baby,  there  is  nothing  like the summertime

Summertime



It was the summertime

When we fell in love, it was the summertime

Heaven  shined  on us; it was the summertime

Call your name two or  three  times in a row

When I talk to my  friends  so quietly

Who he  think  he is? Look at what you did to me

Tennis shoes, don't even need to buy a new dress

If you ain't there, ain't  nobody  else to impress

Looking so  crazy  in love's

Got me looking, got me  looking  so  crazy  in loveI  remember  

When you used to take me on a bike ride  every  day on the  Bayou  (you  remember  that?) 

(We were inseparable)

And I  remember  when you  could  do no wrong

You'd come home from work

And I  jumped  in your arms when I saw you (I was so excited)

I was so  happy  (so  happy  to see you, so  happy  to see you)

I  still  remember I  called  you cryin' 'cause of my tattoo

Could have said, "Beyoncé, I told ya so"

Dangerously in loveSlowly as Sir  Luscious  step up like a Q-Dawg

A-town's up,  deuces  down it's the new call

And you can dial 1-888-cut-something

I'm your  kinky  operator when you  wanna  something

Ain't no dial  tones  just milestones, of  pleasure  to reach

To each his own, I'm a  stone  cold  Aquarian  freak

Humanitarian,  barbarian  but  under  the sheets

It's the  player  from the  point  and your girl from the D



Are you  infatuated  with me?

I  could  end your curiosity?

If you don't  think  I'm too rude

Here's your  chance  to make your move

I sit and wait for nobody

People say that my  style  is so crazy

I  think  you like it baby

Do you want to get nasty?

I dare you to  undress  me



Baby, let me know if you  wanna  roll with Hip Hop

Bamboos on,  pants  down low I'm a rock star

Baby let me know if you  wanna  ride with a Hip Hop star

I'm a rock star



Do I blow you away?

Do I  stimulate  your mind?

Would you  taste  my love if I give you time?

I have none to  waste  with you

I  guess  you can say

My  style  is so crazy

I  think  you like it baby

Do you want to get nasty?

I dare you to  undress  me



Baby, let me know if you  wanna  roll with Hip Hop

Bamboos on,  pants  down low I'm a rock star

Baby let me know if you  wanna  ride with a Hip Hop star

I'm a rock star



Undress me,  undress  me, you can come

Come baby,  undress  me



Take off that tank top and pull off them drawers

The  girls  all pause, got them drippin' down they  sugar  walls

Aw no!  getting  to the  nappy  root

Knocking  boots  in stilettos, damn I keep it ghetto!

A cool type of fellow,  mellow  got the gold medal

Never  settle  for less my rose petal

Tooey, tooey, tooey, tooey! Spit game!

Venom to get it up in 'em, let me "p" pop that thang

First  check  her  brain  to see if she's sane

Deranged or  strange  or  crazy  as hell

You  never  can tell  these  days

Everybody got a  little  Rick  James  in they  veins  man!



The way I feel ooh girl I know it's bout to be

Me all over you and damn girl you all over me



Baby, let me know if you  wanna  roll with Hip Hop

I can't  believe  I  believed  everything we had  would  last

So  young  and  naive  for me to  think  she was from your past

Silly of me to  dream  of one day havin' your kids

Love is so  blind  it  feels  right when it's wrong



I can't  believe  I fell for your schemes, I'm  smarter  than that

So dumb and  naive  to  believe  that with me you're a  changed  man

Foolish of me to  compete  when you  cheat  with  loose  women

It took me some time, but now I  moved  on

Because I  realized  I got



Me, myself, and I, that's all I got in the end

That's what I  found  out

And it ain't no need to cry, I took a vow that from now on

I'm gon' my own best friend

Me, myself, and I, that's all I got in the end

That's what I  found  out

And it ain't no need to cry, I took a vow that from now on

I'm gon' my own best friend



You're so controlling, you say that you love me, but you don't

Your  family  told me one day I  would  see it on my own

Love is so blind, it  feels  right when it's wrong



Now that it's over, stop  calling  me, come pick up yo clothes

Ain't no need to  front  like you're  still  with me, all your  homies  know

My  happiest  moments weren't  complete  if you weren't by my side

You're my  relation  in  connection  to the sun

With you next to me there's no  darkness  I can't overcome

You are my raindrops, I am the seed

With you and God who's the  sunlight  I  bloom  and grow so beautifully

Baby, I'm so proud,  proud  to be your girl

You make the  confusion  go all away from this cold and mixed-up world



[Chorus]

I am in love with you

You set me free

I can't do this  thing  called life  without  you here with me

'Cause I'm  dangerously  in love with you

I'll  never  leave

Just keep lovin' me the way I love you  loving  me

'Cause I am in love with you

You set me free

And I know you love me, love me for who I am

'Cause  years  before I  became  who I am, baby, you were my man

I know it ain't easy, easy  loving  me

I  appreciate  the love and  dedication  from you to me

Later on in my  destiny  I see  myself  having your child

I see  myself  being your wife and I see my  whole  future in your eyes

Thought of all my love for you  sometimes  make me want to cry

Realize all my blessings; I'm  grateful  to have you by my side



[Chorus]



Every time I see your face my  heart  smiles

Every time it  feels  so good it  hurts  sometimes

Created in this  world  to love, to hold, to feel, to breathe, to love you

And tell you how I feel  right  now inside

How I wish, how I wish, how I wish I  could  be with you  right  now (be with you  right  now)



Every morning,  every  afternoon,  every  night

I  wanna  be with you

It don't  matter  if we go to the park or  watch  a play

Stay in a  hotel  room all day, I just  wanna  be with you

I love  everything  about you from your old  school  tennis shoes

To the way you move when you're  dancing  with me



Do you  remember  our  first  kiss?

It wasn't long enough

Remember the  first  time we  spent  those  weeks  together

They were not long enough

All of our conversations

All of your  sweet  pages

They're  never  long enough



When it's time for me to leave

It's so hard to say goodbye

I  never  wanna say goodbye

I  never  ever  wanna  say goodbye



One day (one day) we'll make love (we'll make love)

Finally (finally) I'll be  yours  (I'll be yours)

Tell me what's it  gonna  be



Can we take it there?

They're  about  to close

Give me one more  dance  and I'm  ready  to go

Well the  deejay  playin' all the same  songs  

And the night's  about  to end

By the  quiet  place  where  we can talk

To find out more  about  each other?

Baby, can we

Baby, we  should  get up  outta  here



[Chorus]



You know I'm feelin' you

The night's  about  to be over

You go and tell your boys

Before we leavin', tell me what's it's goin' be



You know I'm feelin' you

You go and tell your boys (yeah)

Before we leavin' tell me what's it's goin' be



[Chorus]You're  holding  me

I  close  my eyes

You're whispering

And I  start  to cry



You feel so good

So beautiful

For as long as you live

Don't let me go



Just hold me

Touch me

Feel me

As long as you love me



Reach for me

And need me

If you  could  trust me

And  teach  me



Never let go of me

Because you're half of me

My  heart  still beats

Looking in the eyes



The eyes of love

I hold your face

And I see the sun

And I  taste  your kiss



You  touch  my soul

I'm  feeling  things

I've  never  felt before

Just hold me



Touch me

Feel me

As long as you love me

Reach for me



And need me

If you  could  trust me

And  teach  me

Never let go of me



Because you're half for me

My  heart  still beats



I am feeling

What they call pure love

I  never  know

Feelings like this



Could exist

Inside of me

I'm soaring

Emotions exploding



I don't want to live

Another day if you're

Not here with me

Just hold me



Touch me

Feel me

As long as you love me

Reach for me



And need me

If you  could  trust me

And  teach  me

Never let go of me



Because you're half of me

My  heart  still beats

Because you're half of me,

Every  radio  'round the  world  know me 'cause that's  where  I be



I'm-a, I'm-a a diva (hey)

[Chorus]



When he pull up,  wanna  pop my hood up

Bet he  better  have a six pack in the cooler

Getting money--divas  getting  money

If you ain't  getting  money, then you ain't got  nothing  for me

Tell me  something  (tell me something)

Where your boss at? (where your boss at?)

Where my  ladies  up in  there  that like to talk back? (that like to talk back)

I  wanna  see ya (I  wanna  see ya)

What you said? (Not to me)

She ain't no diva (she ain't no diva)



[Chorus]



Since  fifteen  in my  stilettos  been  strutting  in this game

What's your age was the  question  they  asked  when I hit the stage

I'm a diva; best  believe  her; you see her; she  getting  paid

She ain't  calling  him to  greet  her; don't need him--her bed's made



This is a  stick  up,  stick  up

I need them bags of that money

A  stick  up,  stick  up

You see them; ask 'em  where  that money

All my  ladies  get it up

I see you, I do the same

Take it to  another  level

No  passengers  on my plane



I'm-a, I'm-a a diva (hey)

I'm-a, I'm-a a diva (hey)

I'm-a, I'm-a a diva (hey)

I'm-a, I'm-a a diva



This is a  stick  up,  stick  up

I need them bags of that money

Stick up,  stick  up

You see 'em; ask  where  that money

Once upon a time  there  was a mountain
That rose out of a vast  green  forest
And in the  forest  there were birds
And  lakes  and  rocks  and  trees  and rivers

The  forest  was also inhabited
By a  small  group of  people  called the lizards
The  lizards  were a  simple  people
And they had  lived  in the  forest  undisturbed
For  thousands  of  years  in  utter  peace and tranquility

Once a year when  spring  came
And the  first  blossoms  began  to show
The  lizards  would  gather  at the base of the mountain
To give  thanks  for all that they had

They  thanked  the birds
And they  thanked  the  lakes  and they  thanked  the rocks
And the  trees  and the rivers
But most importantly, they  thanked  Icculus

Icculus  lived  at the top of the mountain
Or at  least  everyone  thought  so
For no one had  actually  ever seen him

But they knew he existed
Because they had the  Helping  Friendly Book
Icculus had  given  the  Helping  Friendly Book
To the  Lizards  thousands of  years  earlier as a gift

It  contained  all of the knowledge
Inherent in the universe
And had  enabled  the Lizards
To  exist  in  harmony  with  nature  for years

And so they lived
Until one day a  traveler  arrived in Gamehendge
His name was Wilson
And he  quickly  became intrigued
By the  Lizards  way of life

He  asked  if he  could  stay on
And live in the forest
And the Lizards, who had  never  seen an outsider
Were  happy  to oblige

Wilson  lived  with the  Lizards  for a few years
Studying the ways of the  Helping  Friendly Book
And all was well

Until one  morning  when they  awoke  and the book was gone
Wilson  explained  that he had  hidden  the book
Knowing that the  Lizards  had become
Dependent on it for survival

He  declared  himself king
And  enslaved  the  innocent  people of Gamehendge
He cut down the  trees  and  built  a city
Which he  called  Prussia

And in the  center  of the city
He  built  a castle
And  locked  in the  highest  tower of the castle

All the ladies, if you feel me, help me sing it out

Ah, ah (there you go, trippin',  everything  is cool  between  us baby, I told you that)

(Out on the road with my people, just doin' what i  gotta  do) oh

See I been goin' on, the shit be goin' on, got to  trust  me ma



I can't  believe  I  believed  everything we had  would  last

So  young  and  naive  for me to  think  she was from your past

Silly of me to  dream  of one day havin' your kids

Love is so  blind  it  feels  right when it's wrong



I can't  believe  I fell for your schemes, I'm  smarter  than that

So dumb and  naive  to  believe  that with me you're a  changed  man

Foolish of me to  compete  when you  cheat  with  loose  women

It took me some time, but now I  moved  on

Because I  realized  I got



Me, myself, and I, that's all I got in the end

That's what I  found  out

And it ain't no need to cry, I took a vow that from now on

I'm gon' my own best friend

Me, myself, and I, that's all I got in the end

That's what I  found  out

And it ain't no need to cry, I took a vow that from now on

I'm gon' my own best friend



You're so controlling, you say that you love me, but you don't

Your  family  told me one day I  would  see it on my own

Next  thing  I know I'm  dealing  with your  three  kids in my home

Love is so blind, it  feels  right when it's wrong



Now that it's over, stop  calling  me, come pick up yo clothes

Ain't no need to  front  like you're  still  with me, all your  homies  know

Even your very best  friend  tried to warn me on the low

Took me some time, but now I am strong

Because I  realized  I've got



Me, myself, and I, that's all I got in the end

That's what I  found  out

And it ain't no need to cry, I took a vow that from now on

I'm gon' my own best friend

Me, myself, and I, that's all I got in the end

That's what I  found  out

And it ain't no need to cry, I took a vow that from now

I'm gon' my own best friend



(I got me, myself, and I)

I know that I will  never  disappoint myself

(I must have  cried  a  thousand  times)

All the ladies, if you feel me, help me sing it out

(I can't  regret  time  spent  with you)

Yeah, you hurt me, but I  learned  a lot  along  the way

(Now I'm  about  to make it through)

After all the rain, you'll see the sun come out again



(Now I got me, myself, and I)

Hey, I know that I will  never  disappoint myself

(I must have  cried  a  thousand  times)

I've cried, all the ladies, if you feel me, help me sing it out

(I can't  regret  time  spent  with you)

Yeah, you hurt me, but I  learned  a lot  along  the way

(So now I'm  about  to make it through)

After all the rain, you'll see the sun come out again, yeah



Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Oh, oh, oh, oh, woo, woo, ah, hey, yeah 

(I got me, myself, and I)

Me, myself, and I

(I must have  cried  a  thousand  times)

I have  cried  so many times

(I can't  regret  time  spent  with you)

I can't  regret  time  spent  with you

(So now I'm  about  to make it through)

After all the rain, you'll see the sun come out again



(Now I got me, myself, and I)

I know that I will  never  disappoint myself

(I must have  cried  a  thousand  times)

If you  cried  a  thousand  times,  ladies  you will  survive  

(I can't  regret  time  spent  with you)

Yeah, you hurt me, but I  learned  a lot  along  the way

(So now I'm  about  to make it through)

To be  closer  to you

A  heavenly  creation

In the body that

I  never  wanna say goodbye

I  never  ever  wanna  say goodbye



One day (one day) we'll make love (we'll make love)

Finally (finally) I'll be  yours  (I'll be yours)

Only you (only you), only you (only you)

I  could  love you (love you)

But it's too late 

I  already  love you (I love you)

I love you (I love you)

I love you (I love you)

I love you (I love you)All in all you been  there  for me; you  showed  me  things  I  would  never see 

I  think  I'm  ready  

By my side you been  waiting  respectfully and oh-so  patient  

I  think  I'm  ready  



I feel it in my  chest  as I  dance  with you 

You got so much  control  you haven't made a move 

You give me  reassurance  in the  things  you do 

And that's why 

I  think  I'm  ready  



[Chorus]

Baby, I'm not  afraid  

To go the way, but it's my  first  time 

And, baby, I know you want to  change  the  speed  

And I'm-a let you take the lead, but it's my  first  time 

And, baby, I'm not  afraid  

To go the way, but it's my  first  time 

And, baby, I know you want to  change  the  speed  

And I'm-a let you take the lead;  remember  it's my  first  time 



On and on, eye to eye, as the  music  plays,  emotions  rise 

I  think  I'm ready

In your eyes I see  three  words; hold me  tight  'cause I'm  about  to  burst  

I  think  I'm  ready  



I feel it in my  chest  as I  dance  with you 

You got so much  control  you haven't made a move 

You give me  reassurance  in the  things  you do 

And that's why 

I  think  I'm  ready  



[Chorus] 



It felt likeI'm  feelin  sexy

A star

I'm wishing, wishing, wishing

On a star



I'm  wishing  on a star

To  follow  where you are

I'm  wishing  on a dream

To  follow  what it means



And I'm  wishing  on  rainbows  that I see

I'm  wishing  on the  people  who  really  dream

And I'm  wishing  on  tomorrow  rain  never  comes

And I'm  wishing  on all of the  things  we  never  done



I  never  thought I'd see

The time when you  would  be

So far away from home

So far away from me



Just  think  of all the  moments  that we spent

I just can't let you go from me one moment

I didn't mean to hurt you, but I know

In the game of love you reap what you sow (sow)



I feel it's time we  should  make up, baby

I feel it's time for us to get back together

And make the best of things, oh baby

When we're together

Whether or never

I feel it's time we  should  make up, baby

I feel it's time for us to get back together

And make the best of things, oh baby

When we're together

(Let's get together, baby)

Whether or never



I'm  wishing  on a star (wishing on a star)

To  follow  where you are (to  follow  where you are)

I'm  wishing  on a  dream  (wishing on a dream)

To  follow  what it  means  (to  follow  what it means)



And I'm  wishing  on the  rainbows  that I see

I'm  wishing  on the  people  who  really  dream

I'm  hoping  on the days to come and days to go

Hoping on the days of loving,  loving  you so



Baby,  forgive  me; let's make up; I'm sorry

Let's be together; breakup? Never

The love we had's been  special  so far

Till we get back I'm  wishing  on a starHow ya doin',  honey  baby?

You know I don't ask for much

But for a girl spendin' time  alone  can be  pretty  rough



But I get a  knock  on my door

I know it's  yours  for sure

We can't wait for the bedroom, so we just hit the floor



[Chorus]

Is y'all all right?

I don't know, but I know what's  happened  to me, girl, hey

Is y'all all right?

Uh,  break  it down now

He  gotta  work it out

He  gotta  work it out

A  brother  gotta work it out

Whoa, whoa



Child, blow your horn now

Come on, child, blow your horn now



So we're shakin' back and  forth  now

Just keep it comin', babe

Treat my body like a guitar

You gotta, you  gotta  keep on strummin'



But in the back of my mind

Is it  gonna  be the last time?

Well, if it ain't  about  lovin' and you gon' keep it comin'

Well, baby, with me that's fine



[Chorus]



Child, blow your horn now

Come on, child, blow your horn now



I like this

Oh, oh, hey

Uh

Look-a here

Bring it



So, baby, hold me like you don't want to let go

I'm  feeling  foxy 'cause, boy, you're workin' it out

My love, you've  given  me a  taste  of your honey

I want the  whole  beehive

I'm  gonna  call you my  sugar  to fly high

Walking up to me like they know me

Your were the one that  stayed  aside

Waited a  while  and took your time

You don't know how impressing

Your  curiosity  was to me

It was the  fourth  day of July

Looked in my eyes and saw that I



I  wanted  more than just a man

I  needed  a friend

Someone I can talk to  someone  who  really  listens

When you  touched  my hand the sun got  brighter  then

Trusting you I  closed  my eyes and felt our love begin



It was the  summertime  

When we fell in love ot was the  summertime  

Heaven  shined  on us it was the  summertime  

Baby  there  is  nothing  like the summertime

Summertime



Now it's been a year and were closer

Fall in love  again  when I hold ya

I know that God set you  aside  for me

And now you are my prize

Want to grow old witcha

And fill our  house  with your pictures

Have a son for you

A  little  girl for me

Together we'll  raise  a family



Baby you're more than just a man

You are my best friend

Someone I can talk to  someone  who  really  listens

When you  touched  my hand the sun got  brighter  then

Trusting you I  closed  my eyes and felt our love begin



It was the summertime

When we fell in love it was the summertime

Heaven  shined  on us it was the summertime

Baby  there  is  nothing  like the summertime

Summertime



It was the summertime

When we fell in love it was the summertime

Heaven  shined  on us it was the summertime

Baby  there  is  nothing  like the summertime

SummertimeYou're all  alone  and I did this

I've got no one else to blame

You didn't know, I was a risk

And it's such a  crying  shame

How you gave me all of you

And  wanted  nothing else from me

But to make some time for you

But all I made you was lonely



I couldn't see

But I know

That I  acted  selfishly

I  shoulda  known

That I let you down

Caused you so much misery

Forever to bleed

Forever to bleed

Forever to bleed

Forever to bleed

Forever to bleed



I  shoulda  been there

I  shoulda  been there

I  shoulda  been there

I  shoulda  been there



All of the times

You used to cry

Because I  would  let you down

I'm  losing  time

I  shoulda  tried

A  little  more to be around

But I didn't know that you were hurting

I was just to blind

Only  thing  I know for certain

Another you I'll  never  find



I couldn't see

But I know

That I  acted  selfishly

I  shoulda  known

That I let you down

Caused you so much misery

Forever to bleed

Forever to bleed

Forever to bleed

Forever to bleed

Forever to bleed



I  shoulda  been there

I  shoulda  been there

I  shoulda  been there

I  shoulda  been there



I'm  through  with regret

I'm  gonna  tip and soak  myself  in misery

Now in yo life

I'll take more time

No more  yearning  without me

But it  hurts  to  think  of you all by yo self

But now I see

And I  apologize  for all the times

I left you home  waiting  for me!



I couldn't see

But I know

That I  acted  selfishly

I  shoulda  known

That I let you down

Caused you so much misery

Forever to bleed

Forever to bleed

Forever to bleed

Forever to bleed

Forever to bleed

I'm keep my  hands  in my pants; I need to glue 'em with glue

I'm in a trance; all eyes on you and your crew



Me and my mans don't dance, but to feel y'all bump and grind

It won't hurt if you go and try one time

They all hot, but let me see; this one's mine

It's Slim Thug and  DC   outta  H-town



[Chorus: x4]There's  always  that one  person  that will  always  have your heart

You  never  see it comin'  cause  you're  blinded  from the start

Know that you're that one for me

It's  clear  for  everyone  to see

Ooh baby (oh!)

You will  always  be my boo



I don't know  about  y'all

But I know  about  us (oh!)

Star, star
I'm wishing
I'm wishing
On a star

I'm  wishing  on a star
To  follow  where you are
I'm  wishing  on a dream
To  follow  what it means

And I'm  wishing  on the  rainbows  that I see
I'm  wishing  on the  people  who  really  dream
And I'm  wishing  on  tomorrow  rain  never  comes
And I'm  wishing  on all of the  things  we  never  done

I  never  thought I'd see the time when you  would  be
So far away from home
So far away from me
Just  think  of all the  moments  that we spent

I just can't let you go from me, we were meant
I didn't mean to hurt you, but I know
In the game of love, you reap what you sow
(Sow)

I feel it's time we  should  make up baby
I feel it's time for us to get back together
And make the best of things, oh baby
When we're  together  whether or never

I feel, it's time we  should  make up baby
I feel, it's time for us to get back together
And make the best of things, oh baby
When we're together
(Let's get together, baby)
Whether or never

I'm  wishing  on a star
To  follow  where you are
I'm  wishing  on a dream
To  follow  what it means

And I'm  wishing  on the  rainbows  that I see
I'm  wishing  on the  people  who  really  dream
Hoping all the days to come and days to go
Hoping on the days of loving,  loving  you so

Wishing on a star,  wishing  on a dream

Baby,  forgive  me
Lets make up, I'm sorry
Lets be together, breakup? Never
The love we have  seems  special so far
'Til we get back, I'm  wishing  on a star

Love has  truly  been good to me

Not even one sad day 

Or  minute  I had  since  you come my way

I hope you know I  gladly  go

Anywhere you take me



It's so  amazing  to be  loved  

I'll  follow  you to the moon in the sky above



Got to tell you how you  thrill  me

I'm  happy  as I can be

You have come and  changed  my  whole  world

Bye bye  sadness  hello mellow

What a  wonderful  day



It's so  amazing  to be loved

And it's so amazing, so amazing

You give me fever

Fever, oh

Fever in the morning

Fever when it's late at night

You give me fever

Fever when you kiss me

Fever when you hold me tight

You give me fever

Fever in the evening

Fever all  through  the night

You give me fever, yeah

Fever when you're with me

Fever when you love me right



He's so sweet

He's so good to me

He's so intelligent

He's so confident



My baby's so very sexy

(Uh huh)

My baby put the  fever  on me, uh

(Uh huh)

My baby  knows  just what to do

(Uh huh)

You got me boilin' past a  hundred  and two

(Uh huh)

You give me fever, oh

Oh, uh



Never know how much I love you

Never know how much I care

When you put your arms  around  me

I  catch  a  fever  that's so hard to bear



You give me fever

(Fever)

When you kiss me and  fever  when you hold me tight

You give me fever

(Fever)

In the mornin' and  fever  all  through  the night



My baby's so damn sexy

My baby put the  fever  on me

(Uh huh)

My baby  knows  just what to do

(Uh huh)

And got boilin' past a  hundred  and two

Give me a fever

Oh



Everybody's got a fever

That is somethin' you all know

Fever isn't such a new thing

Fever  started  long ago



Romeo  loved  Juliet

And  Juliet  felt the same

When he put his arms  around  her

He said, "Julie, baby, you're my flame"



You give me fever

With your kisses

A  fever  with a  flame  in you



Fever, I'm on fire

Fever, yeah, a burn pursues



Captain  Smith  and Pocahontas

Had a very mad affair

When her  daddy  tried to kill him 

She said, "daddy, oh, don't you dare"



He  gives  me fever

With his kisses

Fever when he  holds  me tight



Fever

I'm his Mrs.

And, daddy, won't you  treat  him right?



Now that you've  listened  to my story

Here's the  point  that I have made

Chicks were born to give ya fever

Be it  Fahrenheit  or  centigrade  



They give ya fever

When ya kiss 'em

And  fever  if you live and learn

Fever till you sizzle



What a  lovely  way to burn

What a  lovely  way to burn

What a  lovely  way to burn



Fever 

Till ya sizzle



What a  lovely  way to burn

What a  lovely  way to burn

What a  lovely  way to burn

What a  lovely  way to burn

What a  lovely  way to burn



Fever[Chorus]

I'm  wishing  on a star to  follow  where you are

I'm  wishing  on a  dream  to  follow  what it means



Check it out, you can  catch  me on top now, playin' a club

Throwin 'a shot down, tryin' to stay above

Ground,  another  ground-breakin' day in the club

Surrounded by my home thoughts, playin' a cut



Reminesin' on days I didn't have a pot to piss in

No  watches  to glisin', no V's with hot systems

Missin' my  homies  that  passed  right in  front  of my eyes

Due to the fast life we told  wonderful  lies



On how we  would  live forever, time  proved  us wrong

Had to get our shit  together  and move it along

Had  dreams  of  being  Big niggas, Jig niggas

Drivin the  hottest  cars,  movin  out with our moms and I'm



[Chorus]

Wishing on a star to  follow  where you are

I'm  wishing  on a  dream  to  follow  what it means



Was  interrupted  by this  chicken  that I used to  cluck  wit

Back in the days when I was movin' much shit, "What up chick?"

Maintanin', it's the same old thang

A  little  stress, a  little  bullshit, ain't too much changed



I see you kept it movin, you see I kept improving, she  nodded  her head in agreement

Remember when I used to walk up and down the cement,  puttin  it down

While the  Streets  is Watchin, stay  hooded  down

Just to earn a rep, but what good is it now?



She said "Damn I just  stopped  to say Hi.... Bye"

I was too deep for you from day one

That's why we  never  had relations,  continued  in my own zone



[Chorus]

I'm  wishing  on a star to  follow  where you are

I'm  wishing  on a  dream  to  follow  what it means

And I wish on all the  rainbows  that I see

I wish on all the  people  who  really  dream

And I'm  wishing  on  tomorrow  praying it will come

And I'm  wishing  on all the  loving  we've ever done



Uh huh, We used to play tap-tap for rap tracks

Run, catch, and kiss in the back park  until  it got dark

Wanted to be like the  older  fellas,  sneak  and  drink  old Chample

Dangerous  games  we  played  on the  third  rail



Fiend for the  summer  breeze

Hopped out the Lee's Dungrares

Into the  Hawaiian  shorts,  relying  on sports

To take us away from here, but I cut too much



So I had a plan B used to  rhyme  with a brush

My  sinners  used to back me up

Like Doug E.  Fresh  and  Ricky  D., Eric,  Mickey  and Me

All my  niggas  is you with me, each of ya'll



Let's  reach  for the  stars  now... Jigga!



[Chorus]

I'm  wishing  on a star to  follow  where you are

I'm  wishing  on a  dream  to  follow  what it means

And I wish on all the  rainbows  that I see

I wish on all the  people  who  really  dream

And I'm  wishing  on  tomorrow  praying it will come

And I'm  wishing  on all the  loving  we've ever doneBass

Uh

Hi hat

Uh

808

Uh

Jay

Uh huh

Ready?

Uh huh

Let's go get 'em

Uh huh, come on



I used to run base like Juan Pierre

Now I run the bass, hi hat, and the snare

I used to bag  girls  like  Birken  Bags

Now I bag B (Boy, you hurtin' that)

Brooklyn Bay  where  they  birthed  me at

Now I be everywhere, the  nerve  of rap

The  audacity  to have me  whipping  curtains back

Me and B, she  about  to sting

Stand back



Baby,  seems  like  everywhere  I go

I see you, from your eyes, your smile

It's like I  breathe  you;  helplessly  I reminisce

Don't want to  compare  nobody to you



Boy, I try to  catch  myself

But I'm out of control

Your  sexiness  is so appealing

I can't let it go, oh



You know that I can't get over you

'Cause  everything  I see is you

And I don't want no substitute

Baby, I  swear  it's déjà vu

Know that I can't get over you

'Cause  everything  I see is you

And I don't want no substitute

Baby, I  swear  it's déjà vu



Seeing  things  that I know can't be

Am I dreaming? When I saw you  walking  past me

Almost  called  your name

Got a  better  glimpse and then I  looked  away

Feels like I'm  losing  it



Boy, I try to  catch  myself

But I'm out of control

Your  sexiness  is so appealing

I can't let it go, oh



Know that I can't get over you

'Cause  everything  I see is you

And I don't want no substitute

Baby, I  swear  it's déjà vu

Know that I can't get over you

'Cause  everything  I see is you

And I don't want no substitute

Baby, I  swear  it's déjà vu



Yes, Hova's flow so unusual

Baby girl, you  should  already know

It's H-O,  light  up the dro'

'Cause you gon' need help tryin' to  study  my bounce

Flow, blow--what's the difference?

One you take in vein  while  the  other  you sniffin'

It's  still  dough--po-po try to  convict  him

That's a no-go; my  dough  keep the  scales  tipping

Like four-fours, like I'm from the H-O-U-S-T-O-N

Blow, wind so  Chicago  of him

Is he the best ever? That's the argument

I don't make the list; don't be mad at me

I just make the hits like a factory

I'm just one-to-one, nothin'  after  me

No déjà vu, just me and my, oh



Baby, I can't go anywhere

Without  thinking  that you're there

Seems like you're everywhere, it's true

Gotta be  having  déjà vu

'Cause in my mind I want you here

Get on the next plane; I don't care

Is it  because  I'm  missing  you

That I'm  having  déjà vu?



Boy, I try to  catch  myself

But I'm out of control

Your  sexiness  is so appealing

I can't let it go



Know that I can't get over you

'Cause  everything  I see is you

And I don't want no substitute

Baby, I  swear  it's déjà vu

Know that I can't get over you

'Cause  everything  I see is you

And I don't want no substitute

Baby, I  swear  it's déjà vu



Know that I can't get over you

'Cause  everything  I see is you

And I don't want no substitute

Baby, I  swear  it's déjà vu

Know that I can't get over you

'Cause  everything  I see is you

And I don't want no substitute

Baby, I  swear  it's déjà vuTo be or not to be 

Not!

Hold up,  bring  the beat back

Stop! I ain't  ready  yet

Wait! Let me fix my hair, yes, yes

Yes ma'am, yes ma'am

Now pass me my dress, yes



I  think  I'm ready

Been  locked  up in the  house  way too long

It's time to get it

'Cause once  again  he's out  doing  wrong



And my  girls  are so real

Said it's been a  minute  since I had some

He's been actin' up

But he won't be the only one

'Cause when he acts wrong, that's when you put it on

Get him uptight, this is your song

'Cause I can't go on and  pretend  like

I haven't  tried  to  forget  this

But I'm much too full of resentment



Just can't seem to get over the way you hurt me

Don't know how you gave  another  who didn't mean a thing, no

The very  thing  you gave to me

I  thought  I  could  forgive you, and I know you've changed

As much as I  wanna  trust you, I know it ain't the same

And it's all  because  you lied



I only give you a hard time

'Cause I can't go on and  pretend  like

I haven't  tried  to  forget  this

But I'm much too full of resentment



I may  never  understand why

I'm  doing  the best that I can, and I

I  tried  and I  tried  to  forget  this

I'm much too full of resentment



I'll  always  remember  feeling  like I was no good

Like I couldn't do it for you like your  mistress  could

And it's all  because  you lied



Loved you more than ever

More than my own life

The best part of me I gave you

It was sacrifice

And it's all  because  you lied



I only give you a hard time

'Cause I can't go on and  pretend  like

I  tried  and I  tried  to  forget  this

But I'm too damn full of resentment



I know she was attractive, but I was here first

Been ridin' with you for six years

Why did I  deserve  to be  treated  this way by you, you?

I know you're  probably  thinking "what's up with B?"

I been  crying  for too long, what did you do to me?

I used to be so strong, but now you took my soul

I'm crying, can't stop crying, can't stop crying

You  could  have told me that you wasn't happy

I know you didn't  wanna  hurt me

But look what you done to me now

I  gotta  look at her in her eyes 

And see she's had half of me (you lie)

How  could  you lie? (you lie)I'm a  train  wreck in the morning

I'm a  bitch  in the afternoon

Every now and then  without  warning

I can be  really  mean  towards  you

I'm a puzzle, yes, indeed

Ever-complex in  every  way

And all the  pieces  aren't even in the box

And yet you see the  picture  clear as day



I don't know why you love me

And that's why I love you

You  catch  me when I fall

Accept me,  flaws  and all

And that's why I love you

And that's why I love you

And that's why I love you



I  neglect  you when I'm working

When I need attention, I tend to nag

I'm a host of imperfection

And you see past all that

I'm a  peasant  by some standards

But in your eyes I'm a queen

You see  potential  in all my flaws

And that's  exactly  what I mean



I don't know why you love me

And that's why I love you

You  catch  me when I fall

Accept me,  flaws  and all

And that's why I love you

And that's why I love you

And that's why I love you



I don't know why you love me

And that's why I love you

You  catch  me when I fall

Accept me,  flaws  and all

And that's why I love you

And that's why I love you

And that's why I love youTo be or not to be 

Not!

Hold up,  bring  the beat back

Stop! I ain't  ready  yet

Wait! Let me fix my hair, yes, yes

Yes ma'am, yes ma'am

Now pass me my dress, yes



I  think  I'm ready

Been  locked  up in the  house  way too long

It's time to get it

'Cause once  again  he's out  doing  wrong



And my  girls  are so real

Said it's been a  minute  since I had some

He's been actin' up

But he won't be the only one

She ain't yo'  average  chick--back up

When you see that girl comin', back up

She ain't yo  average  chick--back up

This is for the, the, the club

And this is for the  people  on the, the, the block



She ain't the  average  chick, she the  baddest  chick

She ain't the  average  chick, she the  baddest  chick



E-e-everybody know that face

Even with her head low, they  still  know that shape

When she come  through  the club,  people  take they place

Chicks throwin'  handcuffs  'cause they knowin' they man ain't safe



'Cause she the one switchin' up flows

If it's four door, two  gotta  go

Chicks like, what  kinda  jeans is those?

And  fellas  watchin' like, please, get low



She ain't the  average  chick, she the  baddest  chick

She ain't the  average  chick, she the  baddest  chick



E-e-everybody can't do this

Some ain't  gotta  clue till they hear me spit

Achoo, I spew 'cause yo' girl is sick

Is it the  change  or the hips--you can't tell, but you know it's thick



'Cause she the one switchin' up flows

If it's four door, two  gotta  go

Chicks like, what  kinda  jeans is those?

And  fellas  watchin' like, please, get low



She ain't the  average  chick, she the  baddest  chick

She ain't the  average  chick, she the  baddest  chick



For this type of girl it's not that hard

You see her 'cause she too far gone

Though they prayin' for her downfall

Why they  gotta  be so envious?

Doin' what it do fit to be a plus

Ven y quédate conmigo, dame el corazón

Vida mía  estoy  muriendo  lento  en mi prisión

Anda dime lo que sientes, quítate el pudor

Y deja de sufrir,  escapa  con mi amor

Después te llevaré  hasta  donde quieras

Sin  temor  y sin fronteras,  hasta  donde sale el sol

Contigo soy  capaz  de lo que sea

No me  importa  lo que venga,  porque  ya sé a  donde  voy



Soy tu gitano, tu peregrino

La única  llave  de tu destino

El que te  cuida  más que a su vida

Soy tu ladrón



Soy tu gitana, tu compañera

La que te sigue, la que te espera

Voy a  quererte  aunque me  saquen  el corazón

Y  aunque  nos  cueste  la vida

Y  aunque  duela lo que duela

Esta  guerra  la ha  ganado  nuestro amor

Esta  guerra  la ha  ganado  nuestro amor



Yo nací para tus ojos, para  nadie  más

Siempre voy a  estar  en tu camino

Alma de mi alma, corazón de tempestad

Dime por dónde ir, después te llevaré  hasta  donde quieras

Sin  temor  y sin fronteras,  hasta  donde sale el sol

Contigo soy  capaz  de lo que sea no me  importa  lo que venga

Porque ya sé a  donde  voy

He said I'm  worth  it, his one desire

I know  things  about that him you wouldn't want to read about

He  kissed  me, his one and only, (yes)  beautiful  liar

Tell me how you  tolerate  the  things  you just  found  out about



You'll  never  know

Why are we the ones who suffer?

I have to let go

He won't be the one to cry



(Ay) Let's not kill the karma

(Ay) Let's not  start  a fight

(Ay) It's not  worth  the drama

For a  beautiful  liar

(Oh) Can't we  laugh  about it?

(Oh) It's not  worth  our time

(Oh) We can live  without  him

Just a  beautiful  liar



I  trusted  him, but when I  followed  you

I saw you together

I didn't know  about  you then till I saw you with him again

I  walked  in on your love scene

Slow dancing

You  stole  everything, how  could  you say I did you wrong?



We'll  never  know

When the pain and heartbreak's over

Have to let go

The  innocence  is gone



(Ay) Let's not kill the karma

(Ay) It's not  worth  the drama

For a  beautiful  liar

Just a  beautiful  liar



Tell me how to  forgive  you (ooh)

When it's me who's  ashamed  (oh)

And I wish I  could  free you

Of the hurt and the pain

But the  answer  is simple

He's the one to  blame  (hey)

Miente, lo ves

Es un juego

(Yo  conozco  cosas del que tú no  quieres  ni saber)

Sabe  decir  lo que  quieres  oír

Un  bello  embustero (solo por  placer  nuestra  amistad  no  vamos  a perder)

A mí también  siempre  quiere  verme  sola

No hay que caer en su  trampa  una vez mas



Ay, no nos pelearemos

Ay, no nos va a engañar

Ay, no terminaremos

Por un  bello  embustero



¡No! ¿nos va dividir? ¡no!

No nos va a  excitar  ¡no!

¿Vamos a sufrir?

Por un  bello  embustero



Confiaba en él

Más  cuando  lo que encontré

Besándote el cuello

(Pero él no lo podía  creer  las dos caímos en su red)

¿Por qué a ti?

Si hay mil por ahí

Él es un perro

(Las dos sin  querer  caímos  presas  en su piel)

A mí también  siempre  quiere  verme  sola

No hay que caer en su  trampa  una vez mas



Ay, no nos pelearemos

Ay, no nos va a engañar

Ay, no terminaremos

Por un  bello  embustero



¡No! ¿nos va dividir? ¡no!

No nos va a  excitar  ¡no!

Vamos a sufrir?

Por un  bello  embustero



Lo creía tan mio

Yo vivía por él

Fuimos un desafió

Que pudo más que él

Es un  hombre  muy frió

No es de una  mujer  ¡Eh!



Ya no nos  puede  engañar (¡ay!)

Paremos con su juego, ya  basta  de sus  mentiras  (ay, oh, oh)

Dile adiós por las dos (¡ay!)



Ay, no nos pelearemos

Ay, no nos va a engañar

Ay, no terminaremos

Por un  bello  embustero



¡No! ¿nos va dividir? ¡no!

No nos va a  excitar  ¡no!

¿Vamos a sufrir?

Just a  beautiful  liarI'm a  train  wreck in the morning

I'm a  bitch  in the afternoon

Every now and then  without  warning

I can be  really  mean  towards  you

I'm a puzzle, yes, indeed

Ever-complex in  every  way

And all the  pieces  aren't even in the box

And yet you see the  picture  clear as day



I don't know why you love me

And that's why I love you

You  catch  me when I fall

Accept me,  flaws  and all

And that's why I love you

And that's why I love you

And that's why I love you



I  neglect  you when I'm working

When I need attention, I tend to nag

I'm a host of imperfection

And you see past all that

I'm a  peasant  by some standards

But in your eyes I'm a queen

You see  potential  in all my flaws

And that's  exactly  what I mean



I don't know why you love me

And that's why I love you

You  catch  me when I fall

Accept me,  flaws  and all

And that's why I love you

And that's why I love you

And that's why I love you



I don't know why you love me

And that's why I love you

You  catch  me when I fall

Accept me,  flaws  and all

And that's why I love you

And that's why I love youNine, four, eight, one

Voy a  olvidar  tu amorListen to the song here in my heart

A  melody  I  start  but can't complete



Listen to the  sound  from deep within

Its only  beginning  to find release



Oh the time has come for my  dreams  to be heard

They will not be  pushed  aside and turned

Into your own, all 'cause you won't listen



Listen, I am  alone  at a crossroads

I'm not at home in my own home

And I've  tried  and tried

To say what's on my mind

You  should  have known

Now I'm done  believing  you

You don't know what I'm feeling

I'm more than what

You've made of me

I  followed  the voice, you gave to me

But now I've  gotta  find my own

You  should  have listened



There was  someone  here inside

Someone I  thought  had died

So long ago

Oh I'm  screaming  out

And my  dreams  will be heard

They will not be  pushed  aside or turned

Into your own

All 'cause you won't listen



Listen, I am  alone  at a crossroads

I'm not at home in my own home

And I've  tried  and tried

To say what's on my mind

You  should  have known

Now I'm done  believing  you

You don't know what I'm feeling

I'm more than what

You've made of me

I  followed  the voice, you gave to me

But now I've  gotta  find my own



I don't know  where  I belong

But I'll be  moving  on

If you don't, if you won't



Listen to the song here in my heart

A  melody  I start, but I will complete



Now I am done  believing  you

You don't know not what I am feeling

I'm more than what you've made of me

I  followed  the  voice  you  think  you gave to me



But now I got to find my own, my ownOye lo que  tengo  que decir

No  puedo  ya  seguir  viviendo así

Oye mmm  huhmm  como  llora  mi canción

Preciso tu atención  debes  oír

Hoy no sé quién soy, ni sé adónde voy

Encontrarme hoy es mi misión

¡De tu prisión por fin ya soy libre!



¡Oye!

Esto no  tiene  salida

Ya nada  sirve  que digas

Tengo que escapar

Yo  tengo  que  escuchar  a mi corazón



Hoy

Buscaré mi  propia  luz

No seas insensible

Soy más de lo que fui por ti

Llena de  valor  voy a partir

Yo  tengo  que  encontrar  mi voz



Nunca  quisiste  que me  fuera  a volar

Callar mi identidad, que gran error

Hoy  grito  no  tengo  más temor

Hoy tu  alumna  te dice adiós

¡De tu prisión por fin ya soy libre, eh, eh!



¡Oye!

Esto no  tiene  salida

Ya nada  sirve  que digas

Tengo que escapar

Yo  tengo  que  escuchar  a mi corazón



¡Hoy!

Buscaré mi  propia  luz

No seas insensible

Soy más de lo que fui por ti

Llena de  valor  voy a partir

Yo  tengo  que  encontrar  mi voz



Yo soy tu gran creación

Por eso es que me voy

Dime adiós, dime adiós



¡Oye!

Lo que  tengo  que decir

No  puedo  ya  seguir  viviendo así

¡Ya me voy!

Buscaré mi  propia  luz

No seas insensible

Soy más de lo que fui por ti

Llena de  valor  hoy ya lo decidí

Yo  tengo  que  encontrar  mi voz

¡Mi voz!I'm so in love

I'm  still  in love



I  never  met love  quite  before

(CHORUS 1X)
Bass

Uh

Hi hat

Uh

808

Uh

Jay

Uh huh

Ready?

Uh huh

Let's go get 'em

Uh huh, come on



I used to run base like Juan Pierre

Now I run the bass, hi hat, and the snare

I used to bag  girls  like  Birken  Bags

Now I bag B (Boy, you hurtin' that)

Brooklyn Bay  where  they  birthed  me at

Now I be everywhere, the  nerve  of rap

The  audacity  to have me  whipping  curtains back

Me and B, she  about  to sting

Stand back



Baby,  seems  like  everywhere  I go

I see you, from your eyes, your smile

It's like I  breathe  you;  helplessly  I reminisce

Don't want to  compare  nobody to you



Boy, I try to  catch  myself

But I'm out of control

Your  sexiness  is so appealing

I can't let it go, oh



You know that I can't get over you

'Cause  everything  I see is you

And I don't want no substitute

Baby, I  swear  it's déjà vu

Know that I can't get over you

'Cause  everything  I see is you

And I don't want no substitute

Baby, I  swear  it's déjà vu



Seeing  things  that I know can't be

Am I dreaming? When I saw you  walking  past me

Almost  called  your name

Got a  better  glimpse and then I  looked  away

Feels like I'm  losing  it



Boy, I try to  catch  myself

But I'm out of control

Your  sexiness  is so appealing

I can't let it go, oh



Know that I can't get over you

'Cause  everything  I see is you

And I don't want no substitute

Baby, I  swear  it's déjà vu

Know that I can't get over you

'Cause  everything  I see is you

And I don't want no substitute

Baby, I  swear  it's déjà vu



Yes, Hova's flow so unusual

Baby girl, you  should  already know

It's H-O,  light  up the dro'

'Cause you gon' need help tryin' to  study  my bounce

Flow, blow--what's the difference?

One you take in vein  while  the  other  you sniffin'

It's  still  dough--po-po try to  convict  him

That's a no-go; my  dough  keep the  scales  tipping

Like four-fours, like I'm from the H-O-U-S-T-O-N

Blow, wind so  Chicago  of him

Is he the best ever? That's the argument

I don't make the list; don't be mad at me

I just make the hits like a factory

I'm just one-to-one, nothin'  after  me

No déjà vu, just me and my, oh



Baby, I can't go anywhere

Without  thinking  that you're there

Seems like you're everywhere, it's true

Gotta be  having  déjà vu

'Cause in my mind I want you here

Get on the next plane; I don't care

Is it  because  I'm  missing  you

That I'm  having  déjà vu?



Boy, I try to  catch  myself

But I'm out of control

Your  sexiness  is so appealing

I can't let it go



Know that I can't get over you

'Cause  everything  I see is you

And I don't want no substitute

Baby, I  swear  it's déjà vu

Know that I can't get over you

'Cause  everything  I see is you

And I don't want no substitute

Baby, I  swear  it's déjà vu



Know that I can't get over you

'Cause  everything  I see is you

And I don't want no substitute

Baby, I  swear  it's déjà vu

Know that I can't get over you

'Cause  everything  I see is you

And I don't want no substitute

Baby, I  swear  it's déjà vu
